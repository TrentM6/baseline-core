## Goal-Setting Frameworks

### OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)

**Structure:**
- **Objective:** Qualitative, inspiring goal (what you want to achieve)
- **Key Results:** Quantitative measures (how you'll know you achieved it)

**Rules:**
- 3-5 objectives per cycle
- 2-4 key results per objective
- Key results are measurable outcomes, not tasks
- Aim for 70% achievement (stretch goals)

**Example:**
```
Objective: Become the go-to resource for product teams

Key Results:
- KR1: Increase monthly active users from 10K to 25K
- KR2: Achieve NPS score of 50+
- KR3: 30% of new users from referrals
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Making key results into tasks ("Launch feature X")
- Too many objectives (lose focus)
- Not ambitious enough (not stretching)
- Too ambitious (demoralizing)
- No regular check-ins

### North Star Metric

**Concept:** One metric that captures the core value you deliver.

**Characteristics:**
- Measures value to customer
- Leading indicator of revenue (not revenue itself)
- Is measurable
- Is actionable

**Examples:**
| Company | North Star |
|---------|------------|
| Airbnb | Nights booked |
| Spotify | Time listening |
| Slack | Messages sent |
| HubSpot | Weekly active teams |

**Finding Your North Star:**
1. What is the core value you provide?
2. What action indicates a user got that value?
3. What predicts long-term retention and revenue?

### SMART Goals

| Letter | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **S** | Specific | "Increase signup conversion rate" |
| **M** | Measurable | "from 3% to 5%" |
| **A** | Achievable | (based on research/benchmarks) |
| **R** | Relevant | "to grow user base" |
| **T** | Time-bound | "by end of Q2" |

**Full example:**
- Not SMART: "Improve the product"
- SMART: "Increase signup conversion rate from 3% to 5% by end of Q2"

## Product Strategy Frameworks

### Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)

**Core Concept:** People "hire" products to do jobs for them.

**Job Statement Format:**
"When I [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]."

**Example:**
"When I'm planning my product roadmap, I want to know what users actually need, so I can build the right things and not waste engineering time."

**Uncovering Jobs:**
- Interview users about recent "purchases" or decisions
- Ask: "What were you trying to accomplish?"
- Dig into the situation, not just preferences
- Look for workarounds and hacks

**Application:**
- Define your product by the job it does, not features
- Compete against all solutions to the same job (not just direct competitors)
- Improve by doing the job better

### Opportunity Solution Trees

**Structure:**
```
                    Outcome (Goal)
                         │
          ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
          │              │              │
    Opportunity    Opportunity    Opportunity
    (User need)    (User need)    (User need)
          │              │              │
     ┌────┴────┐    ┌────┴────┐    ┌────┴────┐
     │         │    │         │    │         │
  Solution  Solution  Solution  Solution  ...
     │         │
  ┌──┴──┐   ┌──┴──┐
  │     │   │     │
Experiment Experiment
```

**Process:**
1. Start with desired outcome (business goal)
2. Identify opportunities (user needs/problems that could drive outcome)
3. Generate multiple solutions for each opportunity
4. Design small experiments to test solutions
5. Iterate based on learnings

**Benefits:**
- Connects solutions to outcomes
- Generates multiple options (not stuck on first idea)
- Builds in validation before building

### Product-Market Fit Assessment

**Sean Ellis Test:**
"How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"

| Response | Percentage |
|----------|------------|
| Very disappointed | 40%+ = PMF achieved |
| Somewhat disappointed | |
| Not disappointed | |

**Other PMF Indicators:**
- Organic growth / word of mouth
- Low churn
- Users do the job without prompting
- Demand exceeds capacity
- Users complain when it's down

### Roadmap Confidence Levels

| Horizon | Confidence | Definition | Timeframe |
|---------|------------|------------|-----------|
| **Now** | High | Committed, well-defined | 0-3 months |
| **Next** | Medium | Planned, somewhat defined | 3-6 months |
| **Later** | Low | Possible, loosely defined | 6+ months |

**Benefits:**
- Sets realistic expectations
- Allows flexibility for learning
- Communicates uncertainty honestly

## Competitive Analysis Frameworks

### Porter's Generic Strategies

**Three strategic positions:**

**1. Cost Leadership:** Win by being cheapest
- Scale, efficiency, low margins
- Example: Walmart, Ryanair

**2. Differentiation:** Win by being different/better
- Unique value, premium pricing
- Example: Apple, Tesla

**3. Focus:** Win by serving a niche deeply
- Narrow market, deep expertise
- Can combine with cost or differentiation
- Example: Specialized B2B SaaS

**Trap:** Stuck in the middle (neither cheapest nor most differentiated)

### Strategy Canvas (Blue Ocean)

**Concept:** Visualize and differentiate your competitive position.

**Process:**
1. List key factors the industry competes on (X-axis)
2. Plot competitors' investment in each factor (Y-axis: Low to High)
3. Plot your current position
4. Design your strategic move

**Four Actions Framework:**
- **Eliminate:** What factors can you stop competing on?
- **Reduce:** What can you reduce below industry standard?
- **Raise:** What can you raise above industry standard?
- **Create:** What new factors can you introduce?

**Example (Cirque du Soleil):**
- Eliminated: Star performers, animal shows, aisle concessions
- Reduced: Fun/humor, thrill/danger
- Raised: Unique venue, artistic music
- Created: Theme, refined environment, multiple productions

### Porter's Five Forces

Analyze industry attractiveness:

**1. Competitive Rivalry**
- How intense is competition?
- Many competitors? Similar products?

**2. Threat of New Entrants**
- How easy to enter this market?
- High barriers = more attractive

**3. Threat of Substitutes**
- What else could solve this problem?
- More substitutes = less attractive

**4. Bargaining Power of Buyers**
- How much leverage do customers have?
- Few big customers = they have power

**5. Bargaining Power of Suppliers**
- How much leverage do suppliers have?
- Few suppliers = they have power

### SWOT Analysis

| | Helpful | Harmful |
|--|---------|---------|
| **Internal** | **Strengths** (leverage) | **Weaknesses** (address) |
| **External** | **Opportunities** (pursue) | **Threats** (mitigate) |

**Process:**
1. Brainstorm each quadrant honestly
2. Connect: Use strengths to capture opportunities
3. Address: Weaknesses that expose you to threats
4. Prioritize: What to act on

**Make it actionable:**
- "We're strong at X" → "How do we leverage X?"
- "Y is a weakness" → "What's the plan to address Y?"

---

## Execution Frameworks

### Hypothesis-Driven Development

**Format:**
"We believe [action] will result in [outcome] because [rationale]. We will know we're right when we see [measurable signal]."

**Example:**
"We believe adding a quick-start guide will increase activation by 20% because new users are currently confused by the setup. We will know we're right when we see activation rate increase within 30 days."

**Process:**
1. State hypothesis clearly
2. Define minimum experiment
3. Set success criteria before running
4. Run experiment
5. Evaluate results objectively
6. Decide: Continue, pivot, or stop

### Agile/Scrum Basics

**Key concepts:**

**Sprint:** Fixed time period (usually 2 weeks)
**Backlog:** Prioritized list of work
**Sprint Planning:** Select work for the sprint
**Daily Standup:** Brief sync (what I did, what I'll do, blockers)
**Sprint Review:** Demo what was built
**Retrospective:** What went well, what to improve

### Now/Next/Later Roadmap

**Now:**
- Currently working on
- Highly defined
- Committed

**Next:**
- Coming up
- Moderately defined
- Planned but flexible

**Later:**
- On the horizon
- Loosely defined
- Possible, not promised

**Benefits over timeline roadmaps:**
- Doesn't create false precision
- Allows flexibility
- Sets appropriate expectations
- Easier to maintain
