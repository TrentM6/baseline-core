## When to Use Which Method

| Goal | Method |
|------|--------|
| Understand problems and needs | Discovery interviews |
| Test if a solution works | Validation interviews |
| Test usability of existing product | Usability testing |
| Quantify attitudes or preferences | Surveys |
| Understand competitive landscape | Competitive analysis |
| Explore market opportunity | Market research |

---

## Discovery Interviews

**Goal:** Understand the problem space, user needs, and current behaviors.

### When to Use
- Starting a new project
- Exploring a new market or user segment
- Don't know what to build yet
- Need to understand "why" behind behaviors

### Question Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Context** | Understand their world | "Walk me through how you currently handle X" |
| **Problem** | Uncover pain points | "What's the hardest part about X?" |
| **Behavior** | Understand current solutions | "What do you do when X happens?" |
| **Motivation** | Understand why | "Why is that important to you?" |
| **Ideal state** | Envision better future | "If you could wave a magic wand, what would change?" |

### Interview Structure (45-60 min)

1. **Warm-up (5 min)** — Build rapport, explain purpose
2. **Context (10 min)** — Understand their role, situation
3. **Current state (15 min)** — How they do things today
4. **Problems & pain (15 min)** — What's not working
5. **Ideal state (10 min)** — What would better look like
6. **Wrap-up (5 min)** — Anything else, thank them

### Key Principles

- **Ask about past behavior, not hypotheticals** — "What did you do last time?" not "What would you do?"
- **Follow the energy** — When they lean in, go deeper
- **Embrace silence** — Let them think and fill the space
- **Don't lead** — "Tell me about X" not "Don't you hate when X?"
- **Get specific** — "Can you give me an example?" is your best follow-up

---

## Validation Interviews

**Goal:** Test if a specific concept or solution resonates.

### When to Use
- Have a hypothesis to test
- Evaluating concept directions
- Deciding between options
- Need to know if solution fits the problem

### Question Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Reaction** | First impression | "What's your initial reaction to this?" |
| **Comprehension** | Do they get it | "In your own words, what does this do?" |
| **Relevance** | Does it matter to them | "How relevant is this to your situation?" |
| **Preference** | Compare options | "Which of these resonates more? Why?" |
| **Adoption** | Would they use it | "What would need to be true for you to try this?" |

### Interview Structure (30-45 min)

1. **Context recap (5 min)** — Confirm their situation
2. **Problem confirmation (10 min)** — Verify the problem exists
3. **Concept presentation (5 min)** — Show the concept neutrally
4. **Reaction & feedback (15 min)** — Gather honest response
5. **Refinement (5 min)** — What would make it better
6. **Wrap-up (5 min)** — Final thoughts

### Key Principles

- **Present neutrally** — Don't sell, don't apologize
- **Watch for politeness** — People want to be nice; push for honest critique
- **Test the problem first** — Confirm they have the problem before showing solution
- **Separate "interesting" from "useful"** — Would they actually use it?

---

## Usability Testing

**Goal:** Identify friction in an existing interface or flow.

### When to Use
- Have a working prototype or product
- Want to improve specific flows
- Need to validate design decisions
- Identifying why users drop off

### Task-Based Structure

1. **Define tasks** — What should they accomplish?
2. **Set scenarios** — Give them realistic context
3. **Observe without helping** — Watch them struggle (it's hard)
4. **Ask them to think aloud** — "Tell me what you're thinking"
5. **Debrief** — What was hard? What was confusing?

### What to Capture

- Task completion (did they finish?)
- Time on task
- Errors and wrong paths
- Verbal reactions and confusion
- Points where they hesitated

---

## Synthesis Patterns

### Affinity Mapping

**Purpose:** Group raw observations into themes.

**Process:**
1. Write each observation on a sticky (or card)
2. Group similar observations together
3. Name each group (that's your theme)
4. Look for patterns across groups

### Insight Extraction

**From observation to insight:**

| Level | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Observation** | "3 of 5 users looked for a search bar first" |
| **Pattern** | "Users expect search to be primary navigation" |
| **Insight** | "Users are goal-oriented, not exploratory — they come with a specific task" |
| **Implication** | "Optimize for search and task completion, not browsing" |

### The "So What?" Test

Every insight should answer: **"So what should we do about it?"**

If you can't answer that, dig deeper or reframe.

## Research Deliverable Structures

### User Research Report

1. **Executive Summary** — Key findings in 1 page
2. **Research Goals** — What we set out to learn
3. **Methodology** — Who we talked to, how
4. **Key Findings** — Organized by theme, with evidence
5. **Recommendations** — What to do next

### Validation Report

1. **Executive Summary** — Did it work? Key learnings.
2. **What We Tested** — The concept(s) and hypotheses
3. **Who We Tested With** — Participant profile
4. **Findings by Concept** — What resonated, what didn't
5. **Refined Direction** — Updated recommendation

### Prioritization Framework

1. **Criteria** — What factors matter (impact, effort, confidence)
2. **Scoring** — How to evaluate options
3. **Ranked List** — Options in priority order
4. **Rationale** — Why this order

## Sample Sizes

| Method | Minimum | Recommended |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Discovery interviews | 5 | 8-12 |
| Validation interviews | 5 | 6-10 |
| Usability testing | 5 | 5-8 |
| Surveys (quantitative) | 100 | 200+ |

**Rule of thumb:** You'll hear the main themes after 5 interviews. Additional interviews confirm and add nuance.

---

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Leading questions** | You get the answer you want, not the truth | Ask open questions, stay neutral |
| **Confirmation bias** | You only hear what supports your hypothesis | Actively look for disconfirming evidence |
| **Solution-first thinking** | You test a solution before understanding the problem | Always validate problem existence first |
| **Hypothetical questions** | People can't predict their future behavior | Ask about past behavior instead |
| **Too few participants** | You might miss key patterns | Minimum 5 per segment |
| **No synthesis** | Raw notes don't become insights | Always synthesize into themes and implications |
| **Vague recommendations** | Findings without action | Every insight needs a "so what" |

## Participant Recruitment

### Finding Participants

| Source | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| Client's existing users | Validation, usability testing |
| Client's prospect list | Discovery with potential users |
| Screening survey | Finding specific segments |
| Your network | Quick pilot testing |
| Recruitment services | Hard-to-reach populations |

### Screening Criteria

Define:
- **Must have** — Required characteristics
- **Nice to have** — Preferred but not required
- **Exclude** — Who shouldn't participate

### Incentives

| Interview Length | Typical Incentive |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 30 minutes | $50-75 |
| 45 minutes | $75-100 |
| 60 minutes | $100-150 |

For B2B/executive interviews, may be higher or replaced with donation to charity.
