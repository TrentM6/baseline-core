## When to Use Which Framework

| Situation | Framework |
|-----------|-----------|
| Landing pages, feature announcements | AIDA |
| Cold outreach, problem-focused content | PAS |
| Quality check on any copy | 4Cs |
| Social posts, short-form content | Hook → Value → CTA |

---

## AIDA Framework

**Attention → Interest → Desire → Action**

Use for: Landing pages, email sequences, feature announcements, ads.

### Structure

1. **Attention** — Grab attention with a bold statement, question, or hook
2. **Interest** — Build interest by explaining the problem or opportunity
3. **Desire** — Create desire by showing the solution and its benefits
4. **Action** — Direct them to take a specific next step

### Example (Landing Page)

**Attention:**
> Figure out what to build. Then build it 10x faster.

**Interest:**
> Product teams are shipping fast in the wrong direction. The bottleneck isn't execution anymore — it's knowing what's worth building.

**Desire:**
> Research when you need direction. AI workflows when you need speed. Advisory when you need a partner. One senior operator, no agency bloat.

**Action:**
> Work with me →

### Tips
- Attention must be specific to your audience (not generic clickbait)
- Interest should acknowledge their current pain
- Desire should paint a picture of life after the problem is solved
- Action should be one clear CTA (not multiple options)

## PAS Framework

**Problem → Agitate → Solution**

Use for: Outreach messaging, problem-aware content, ads.

### Structure

1. **Problem** — State the problem clearly and specifically
2. **Agitate** — Make the problem feel urgent, explore consequences
3. **Solution** — Present your solution as the answer

### Example (Cold Outreach)

**Problem:**
> Most product teams are busy but can't tell if they're making real progress.

**Agitate:**
> They've tried hiring, tried agencies, adopted AI tools — but nothing actually changed how fast they ship. Meanwhile, competitors are moving faster.

**Solution:**
> I help teams figure out what's actually worth building, then implement AI workflows so they ship 10x faster. One senior operator, no overhead.

### Tips
- Problem should be instantly recognizable to your audience
- Agitate shouldn't be manipulative — just honest about consequences
- Solution should feel like natural relief, not a hard sell
- Works especially well when audience is problem-aware but not solution-aware

## 4Cs Quality Filter

**Clear, Concise, Compelling, Credible**

Use for: Quality checking any piece of copy before publishing.

### The Checklist

| C | Question | If No... |
|---|----------|----------|
| **Clear** | Can someone understand this in 5 seconds? | Simplify language, cut jargon, restructure |
| **Concise** | Can I cut words without losing meaning? | Remove filler, tighten sentences, combine ideas |
| **Compelling** | Would this make my audience care? | Add specifics, connect to their pain, show stakes |
| **Credible** | Can I back this up? Is it honest? | Add proof, remove unverifiable claims, tone down |

### Application

Run every piece of copy through this filter before publishing:

1. Read it fresh (after a break if possible)
2. Ask each question honestly
3. Rewrite sections that fail
4. Repeat until all four pass

### Common Failures

| Failure | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Not clear | "We leverage synergistic solutions" | "We help teams ship faster" |
| Not concise | "In order to be able to..." | "To..." |
| Not compelling | "We offer consulting services" | "I help you figure out what to build" |
| Not credible | "We're the best in the industry" | "10+ years shipping at scale" |

## Hook → Value → CTA

**For short-form content (social posts, short emails)**

Use for: LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads, brief announcements.

### Structure

1. **Hook** (1-2 lines) — Stop the scroll. Make them want to read more.
2. **Value** (3-8 lines) — Deliver the insight, story, or information.
3. **CTA** (1 line) — What should they do next?

### Example (LinkedIn Post)

**Hook:**
> The bottleneck has shifted.

**Value:**
> In 2020, building was the slow part. Interfaces took months.
>
> Now AI generates them in hours. Execution isn't the constraint.
>
> But knowing what to build — what users actually need, what's worth the investment — that still takes real work.
>
> Most teams skip it and ship fast in the wrong direction.

**CTA:**
> That's what I focus on at Baseline.

### Tips
- Hook should create curiosity or pattern interrupt
- Value should be genuinely useful (not a tease)
- CTA can be soft (just a statement) or direct (link, ask)
- Don't bury the hook — first line matters most

| Your Goal | Use This |
|-----------|----------|
| Convert visitors on a page | AIDA |
| Start a conversation from cold | PAS |
| Verify quality before publishing | 4Cs |
| Get engagement on social | Hook → Value → CTA |
| Long-form content (articles) | AIDA structure, expanded |

## Combining Frameworks

Frameworks can layer:

1. **Write** using AIDA or PAS for structure
2. **Check** using 4Cs for quality
3. **Adapt** using Hook → Value → CTA for social distribution

Example flow:
- Draft landing page copy using AIDA
- Run 4Cs filter to tighten and verify
- Extract key insight for LinkedIn post using Hook → Value → CTA
