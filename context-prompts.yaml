# Context Prompts — Questions asked during `baseline init` to populate context files.
# Each key is a context file path relative to context/.
# Questions are asked in terminal; answers written into the markdown file.

# These questions are designed to extract enough detail to make the system
# produce high-quality, on-brand output. Short answers are fine — but the
# more specific you are, the better the system works.
