# Contributing to Baseline Core

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## How to contribute

1. **Open an issue first.** Describe what you want to change and why. This lets us discuss the approach before you write code.
2. **Fork the repo and create a branch** from `main`.
3. **Make your changes.** Keep them focused — one issue per PR.
4. **Link the issue** in your pull request description.
5. **Submit the PR.** We'll review and get back to you.

## What we're looking for

- Bug fixes in the CLI
- Improvements to existing skills and frameworks
- New script integrations
- Documentation fixes

## What to avoid

- Don't submit large refactors without discussing first
- Don't add dependencies unless absolutely necessary
- Don't modify context template files — those are user-facing

## Questions?
