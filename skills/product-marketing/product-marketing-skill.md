# Product Marketing

Product marketing bridges what you build and how the market understands it. It's the strategic layer that defines positioning, crafts messaging hierarchies, and ensures every touchpoint — from landing pages to launch briefs — communicates a consistent, compelling story about the product.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Positioning before promotion.** If you can't articulate why this product matters in one sentence, no amount of content will fix it. Get the positioning right first.

2. **Prove, don't claim.** "10+ years shipping at scale" beats "experienced professional." Show evidence, not adjectives.

3. **Research-first positioning.** The same thinking you sell is in how you position. Figure out the market before crafting the message.

4. **Sound like a peer, not a marketer.** Messaging should feel like advice from a senior operator, not a pitch from a vendor. If it reads like marketing, rewrite it.

5. **One insight per piece.** Don't cram. Each message, page, or brief should deliver one clear, valuable idea the audience can act on.

6. **Specificity creates credibility.** "50,000 users" beats "many users." Concrete details earn trust. Vague claims erode it.

7. **Every piece has a job.** Awareness, consideration, or conversion. Know which before writing.

### Industry Principles

8. **Know your audience deeply.** What are they reading? What keeps them up at night? What language do they use? Messaging that doesn't speak their language doesn't land.

9. **Competitive positioning is relative.** You're not positioning in a vacuum. You're positioning against alternatives — including doing nothing. Know the landscape.

10. **Messaging compounds.** Consistent, differentiated positioning builds market awareness over time. Inconsistent messaging resets the clock.

11. **The buyer's context matters more than your features.** Frame everything in terms of the problem they're solving, not the thing you built.

12. **Test messaging before scaling it.** A positioning statement that feels right internally may not resonate externally. Validate with real conversations and data.

## Workflow

> Follow the [Workflow Orchestration Pattern](../../frameworks/workflow-orchestration.md) for the universal workflow approach. Below are the product marketing-specific details for each step.

### 1. Clarify Before Starting

Before creating any product marketing deliverable, answer:

- **Deliverable:** Positioning strategy, messaging framework, launch brief, competitive messaging, case study, landing page?
- **Product or feature:** What specific product, feature, or service are we positioning?
- **Audience:** Which buyer persona? What's their mindset and stage?
- **Competitive context:** What alternatives exist? What are we positioning against?
- **Key message:** What's the one thing they should take away?
- **Job:** Awareness, consideration, or conversion?

### 2. Load Relevant Context

**Core context (always load):**
- `core/identity.md` — Services, positioning, proof points, terminology
- `core/voice.md` — Tone, style, language guidelines

**Extended context (load for product marketing):**
- `extended/icp.md` — Ideal client profile, personas, what they care about
- `extended/competitive.md` — Competitive landscape, positioning gaps
- `extended/proof-points.md` — Evidence, metrics, client outcomes, market research, industry data

**Load when needed:**
- [Product Messaging Playbooks](references/product-messaging-playbooks.md) — Templates for specific deliverable types
- [Positioning Strategy](references/positioning-strategy.md) — Strategic frameworks for positioning and pillar planning

### 3. Choose the Right Approach

| Deliverable | Key Considerations |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Positioning strategy | Market landscape, competitive gaps, differentiation, ICP alignment |
| Messaging framework | Hierarchy (primary → secondary → proof), audience adaptation |
| Launch brief | Timing, channels, audience segments, success metrics |
| Competitive messaging | Strengths/weaknesses mapping, battle cards, handling objections |
| Case study | Outcomes-focused, proof of positioning claims |
| Landing page | Conversion-focused, clear value prop, one CTA |

### 4. Draft and Refine

**First Draft:**
- Write fast, don't self-edit
- Get the core positioning and message down
- Don't worry about word count or perfection yet

**Refinement Pass:**
- Cut ruthlessly (can I say this in fewer words?)
- Check voice (does this sound like the brand?)
- Verify claims (can I back this up with proof points?)
- Run 4Cs filter (Clear, Concise, Compelling, Credible)

**Final Check:**
- Does the positioning differentiate from alternatives?
- Could a competitor say this? If yes, it's not specific enough
- 5-second test — is the main point obvious?

## Deliverable Types

### Positioning Strategy

**Purpose:** Define how the product is understood in the market relative to alternatives.

**Components:**
1. Market category definition — What space are you in?
2. Target audience — Who is this for, specifically?
3. Key problem — What urgent problem does this solve?
4. Unique value proposition — Why are you the best answer?
5. Competitive differentiation — How are you different from alternatives?
6. Proof points — What evidence supports your claims?
7. Positioning statement — The synthesized, one-paragraph summary

**Positioning Statement Formula:**
> For [target audience] who [key problem], [product] is the [market category] that [unique value proposition]. Unlike [competitive alternative], we [key differentiator].

**Principles:**
- Positioning is a strategic decision, not a tagline exercise
- Must be grounded in real market data and customer language
- Should be specific enough that a competitor can't say the same thing
- Must be defensible — every claim backed by evidence

### Messaging Framework

**Purpose:** Create a hierarchy of messages that adapts to different audiences and contexts.

**Structure:**

**Primary Message (The One Thing):**
- 1 sentence that captures the core value proposition
- Works for all audiences, all channels
- Should pass the "could a competitor say this?" test — if yes, sharpen it

**Secondary Messages (Supporting Pillars — 3 max):**
- Each supports the primary message from a different angle
- Each maps to a specific audience concern or buyer priority
- Each is backed by at least one proof point

**Proof Points (Evidence Layer):**
- Specific metrics, outcomes, or credentials that validate each secondary message
- Organized by anonymization status (public vs. anonymized)
- Cross-referenced with proof-points.md

**Audience Adaptations:**
- How to adjust emphasis for each persona (CEO vs. Head of Product vs. COO)
- Which secondary messages resonate with which audience
- Channel-specific formatting (website vs. conversation vs. deck)

### Launch Brief

**Purpose:** Coordinate how a product, feature, or service reaches the market.

**Structure:**
1. **What's launching** — Clear description of the product/feature
2. **Who it's for** — Target audience segments, prioritized
3. **Why now** — Market timing, competitive context, customer demand signal
4. **Key message** — Primary positioning statement for this launch
5. **Success metrics** — What does a successful launch look like?
6. **Channel plan** — Where and how the message reaches each audience
7. **Timeline** — Key milestones and dependencies
8. **Team responsibilities** — Who owns what

**Launch Brief Principles:**
- Keep it to 1-2 pages — if it's longer, it's a plan, not a brief
- Every section should be actionable, not aspirational
- Success metrics must be measurable within 30 days of launch

### Competitive Messaging

**Purpose:** Arm the team with specific language for positioning against alternatives.

**Deliverables:**

**Battle Cards (per competitor):**
- Competitor overview (what they offer, who they serve)
- Their strengths (be honest — acknowledge where they're strong)
- Their weaknesses (where your offering wins)
- Common objections when this competitor comes up
- Recommended talking points
- What NOT to say (avoid claims you can't defend)

**Competitive Positioning Map:**
- 2x2 matrix plotting key competitors on relevant dimensions
- Clear visual of where you differentiate
- Should immediately communicate your positioning advantage

**Principles:**
- Never trash competitors — acknowledge strengths, then differentiate
- Focus on what's true and provable, not spin
- Update regularly — competitive landscapes shift

### Case Studies

**Purpose:** Prove positioning claims with real outcomes.
**Length:** 500-800 words

**Structure:**
1. Client snapshot (context without naming if needed)
2. Challenge (what they faced)
3. Approach (what was done)
4. Results (outcomes, metrics)
5. Key insight (what was learned)

**Principles:**
- Focus on outcomes, not process heroics
- Include specific metrics where possible
- Let the transformation tell the story
- Match the case study to the positioning pillar it proves
- Respect anonymization requirements — check proof-points.md

### Landing Pages

**Purpose:** Convert visitors to leads or customers
**Use:** Lead magnets, product launches, service pages

**Structure (AIDA/PAS hybrid):**
1. Hero: Bold headline, clear value prop, primary CTA
2. Problem: Acknowledge the pain they're feeling
3. Agitation: Make it feel urgent (cost of inaction)
4. Solution: Introduce your answer
5. Benefits: What they get (outcomes, not features)
6. Proof: Testimonials, case studies, logos
7. Objections: Address common concerns
8. CTA: Repeat the action
9. Guarantee: Reduce risk (if applicable)

**Conversion copy principles:**
- One job per page — know the single action you want
- Benefits before features — what does it mean for them?
- Specificity creates credibility — "50,000 users" beats "many users"
- Address objections before they become reasons to leave
- Every word earns its place — if you can cut it, cut it

**Headlines that work:**

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Benefit-first | "Ship products 10x faster" |
| Problem-agitate | "Still shipping the wrong features?" |
| How-to | "How to validate ideas before building" |
| Question | "What if your roadmap is the problem?" |
| Social proof | "Why 500+ teams switched" |

## Audience Segmentation for Product Decisions

Product marketing doesn't just inform external messaging — it informs what to build. Audience segmentation feeds back into product prioritization.

### Segmentation Framework

For each audience segment, define:
1. **Who they are** — Role, company stage, team size
2. **What they need** — Their core problem and desired outcome
3. **How they buy** — Decision process, evaluation criteria, timeline
4. **What they value** — Which product capabilities matter most
5. **Product implications** — What does this segment's priority mean for the roadmap?

### Segment-to-Product Mapping

| Segment Priority | Product Implication |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| High-value, underserved | Build or expand features for this segment |
| High-value, well-served | Protect and deepen — don't break what works |
| Low-value, underserved | Deprioritize — don't chase segments that don't justify investment |
| Low-value, well-served | Maintain but don't invest — let it ride |

### When Segmentation Feeds Product

Use this when:
- Prioritizing which features to build next
- Deciding which use cases to support first
- Evaluating market expansion opportunities
- Resolving conflicting feature requests from different user types

## When to Escalate

Flag for review when:

- Positioning represents a significant strategic shift
- Competitive messaging makes claims that could be challenged
- Mentioning specific clients by name (need approval)
- Pricing or scope statements in public-facing content
- Content that will be widely distributed (ads, PR, investor materials)
- Messaging conflicts with existing positioning in other channels
- Audience segmentation suggests a major product pivot
