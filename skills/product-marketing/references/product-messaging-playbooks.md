## Positioning Statement Playbook

### The Positioning Statement Template

```
For [target audience]
who [situation or problem],
[product/service] is the [market category]
that [key benefit/value proposition].
Unlike [competitive alternative],
we [key differentiator supported by proof].
```

### Positioning Statement Checklist

- [ ] Target audience is specific (not "everyone")
- [ ] Problem is real and urgent (not aspirational)
- [ ] Market category is one they already understand
- [ ] Value proposition is outcome-focused (not feature-focused)
- [ ] Competitive alternative is named or implied clearly
- [ ] Differentiator is provable (supported by evidence)
- [ ] Could NOT be said by a competitor

### Example: Strong vs. Weak

**Weak:**
> For companies that want to innovate, Baseline is a consulting service that helps with product strategy and AI implementation.

**Strong:**
> For product teams shipping without confidence in direction, Baseline is the AI workflow system that turns research into shipped product decisions in days, not months. Unlike agencies, you work directly with one senior operator — and own the system after.

**Why the strong version works:**
- Specific audience (product teams shipping without confidence)
- Clear problem (no confidence in direction)
- Concrete outcome (research → decisions in days)
- Named differentiator (not agencies, one senior operator)
- Proof of permanence (own the system after)

## Messaging Framework Playbook

### Building the Hierarchy

**Step 1: Primary Message**
The one sentence that captures everything. Must work standalone in any context.

Test: If someone reads only this sentence and nothing else, do they understand what you do and why it matters?

**Step 2: Secondary Messages (3 max)**
Each secondary message:
- Supports the primary from a different angle
- Maps to a specific audience concern
- Is backed by at least one proof point
- Can stand on its own in the right context

**Step 3: Proof Points**
For each secondary message, list:
- 2-3 specific evidence items (metrics, outcomes, credentials)
- Anonymization status (public vs. anonymized)
- Which contexts each can be used in (website, conversation, deck)

**Step 4: Audience Adaptations**
For each key persona, note:
- Which secondary message resonates most
- Language adjustments (technical vs. strategic vs. operational)
- What they care about that others don't

### Messaging Framework Template

```
PRIMARY MESSAGE
[One sentence — the core value proposition]

SECONDARY MESSAGE 1: [Theme]
Message: [1-2 sentences]
Proof: [Specific evidence]
Best for: [Which persona and context]

SECONDARY MESSAGE 2: [Theme]
Message: [1-2 sentences]
Proof: [Specific evidence]
Best for: [Which persona and context]

SECONDARY MESSAGE 3: [Theme]
Message: [1-2 sentences]
Proof: [Specific evidence]
Best for: [Which persona and context]

AUDIENCE ADAPTATIONS
[Persona 1]: Lead with [message], emphasize [aspect]
[Persona 2]: Lead with [message], emphasize [aspect]
[Persona 3]: Lead with [message], emphasize [aspect]
```

## Competitive Battle Card Playbook

### Battle Card Structure

```
COMPETITOR: [Name]
UPDATED: [Date]

OVERVIEW
[2-3 sentences: what they offer, who they serve, their positioning]

THEIR STRENGTHS (be honest)
- [Strength 1]
- [Strength 2]
- [Strength 3]

WHERE WE WIN
- [Advantage 1 + supporting proof]
- [Advantage 2 + supporting proof]
- [Advantage 3 + supporting proof]

COMMON OBJECTIONS WHEN THEY COME UP
Objection: "[What the prospect says]"
Response: "[How to address it]"

Objection: "[What the prospect says]"
Response: "[How to address it]"

RECOMMENDED TALKING POINTS
- [What to say when this competitor is mentioned]
- [How to reframe the conversation]

WHAT NOT TO SAY
- [Claims you can't defend]
- [Comparisons that backfire]
```

### Battle Card Principles

- **Be honest about competitor strengths.** Prospects already know them. Acknowledging strengths builds credibility for your differentiation claims.
- **Focus on provable advantages.** "We're better" means nothing. "Our clients own the system after the engagement — theirs don't" is specific.
- **Update regularly.** Competitive landscapes shift. Stale battle cards are worse than none.
- **Train the team.** A battle card nobody uses is a battle card that doesn't exist.

## Website Copy Playbook

### Homepage Structure

**Hero Section:**
- Headline: The transformation you offer
- Subhead: How you deliver it
- CTA: Primary action
- Credibility: Quick proof (logos, stat, or statement)

**Problem Section:**
- Acknowledge the pain they're feeling
- Show you understand their situation
- Make them feel seen

**Solution Section:**
- How you address this
- What makes it different
- Clear value proposition

**Services Section:**
- Key offerings, briefly explained
- What each is for
- Link to learn more

**Proof Section:**
- Case study preview or results
- Client logos if available
- Specific outcomes

**CTA Section:**
- Reinforce the value
- Clear next step
- Reduce friction

### Section Writing Formula

Each section should:
1. **Earn the scroll** — Give them a reason to keep reading
2. **Deliver value** — Don't just tease, actually say something
3. **Build to CTA** — Every section moves toward action

### Headline Formulas

**Transformation:**
> Figure out what to build. Then build it 10x faster.

**Problem → Solution:**
> Shipping fast in the wrong direction? Get clarity first.

**Benefit Statement:**
> Research when you need direction. AI workflows when you need speed.

**Direct Value:**
> What you'd get from a top firm, delivered by one senior operator.

## Case Study Pipeline Playbook

A full pipeline from raw source material to published case study and derivative content.

### Stage 1: Source Material Intake

**Inputs:** Engagement summary, client outcomes, deliverable samples, internal notes

**Actions:**
- Identify the source type and completeness
- Check `proof-points.md` for existing evidence from this client
- Determine anonymization requirement: check the Status column in proof-points.md. If "Anonymized only," all output must use a generic descriptor, never the real name

### Stage 2: Metric Extraction

Pull 5-10 key data points from the source material:
- Quantitative metrics (timeline, delivery speed, adoption, outcomes)
- Qualitative outcomes (workflow changes, team dynamics, capability gains)
- Quotes (if available and approved)
- Timeline and engagement context

**Output:** Structured metric brief — a bulleted list of facts, each tagged with its anonymization status.

### Stage 3: Anonymization (If Required)

- Replace company name with generic industry descriptor (e.g., "Series B Fintech Startup")
- Remove identifying details: team names, product names, locations
- Keep metrics, outcomes, and methodology — these are the value
- Cross-check every derivative in Stage 6 for consistency

### Stage 4: Draft Case Study (500-800 words)

**Structure:**

**1. Client Snapshot (50 words)**
- Company type/stage (anonymized if required)
- Team size, industry, what they do

**2. The Challenge (100 words)**
- What problem they faced and why it mattered
- What they'd tried before, stakes of not solving it

**3. The Approach (150 words)**
- What was provided
- Key methodologies used, how the engagement worked, timeline

**4. The Results (150 words)**
- Specific outcomes and metrics
- Qualitative changes, what's different now

**5. Key Insight (100 words)**
- What was learned, what this means for similar organizations

### Stage 5: Client Approval Gate

- **Public case study:** Requires explicit client approval before any external use
- **Anonymized case study:** Can be used externally if properly anonymized per Stage 3
- **Internal only:** Can be used for internal strategy without approval
- **Flag for review:** Any use of named client beyond logo permission

### Stage 6: Derivative Content

Once the case study is approved, produce derivatives:

| Derivative | Format | Use |
|------------|--------|-----|
| Pull quotes | 1-2 key metrics + insight | Website, presentations |
| Deck metrics | 3-5 headline stats, formatted for slides | Sales conversations |
| Talking points | Verbal summary for conversations | Meetings |
| Blog post | Expanded narrative, 800-1200 words | Consideration stage |

### Writing Principles

- **Lead with outcomes, not process.** They care about results
- **Be specific.** "+59% throughput" beats "improved efficiency"
- **Let the transformation speak.** Minimal self-congratulation
- **Show the before and after.** Make the change tangible
- **Anonymize consistently.** If the source is anonymized, every derivative is anonymized
