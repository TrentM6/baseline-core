## Positioning Pillars

Every piece of product marketing should map to a positioning pillar. Each pillar has a clear thesis, target personas, and proof points to draw from. Define 3-5 pillars that collectively tell the full story of why your product matters.

### How to Define a Pillar

Each pillar needs:

1. **Thesis** — The core argument this pillar makes (2-3 sentences)
2. **Key Messages** — 3-5 specific claims that support the thesis
3. **Target Personas** — Which buyer roles this pillar resonates with and why
4. **Proof Points** — Specific evidence that validates the thesis (cite from proof-points.md)
5. **Content Angles** — 3-5 specific ways to express this pillar in market-facing content

### Pillar Balance

Over any 30-day period, positioning should have roughly equal coverage across pillars, with heavier weight on pillars aligned to current business priorities. Audit regularly:

- Which pillars are overrepresented in your messaging?
- Which pillars are underserved?
- Do current priorities justify the imbalance, or has messaging drifted?

### Pillar-to-Audience Mapping

| If your primary audience cares about... | Lead with pillar... |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Direction and confidence | Research/clarity pillar |
| Competitive pressure and speed | Technology/efficiency pillar |
| Past bad experiences with vendors | Differentiation/model pillar |
| Scaling processes | Systems/platform pillar |
| ROI and accountability | Outcomes/proof pillar |

## Competitive Positioning Frameworks

### Positioning Map (2x2 Matrix)

Plot competitors on two dimensions that matter to your market. The goal is to find the quadrant where you win and can defend.

**How to choose axes:**
- Each axis should represent a real buyer priority
- Axes should be independent (not correlated)
- Your product should land in a clearly differentiated quadrant
- Avoid self-serving axes that make you look good but don't reflect buyer thinking

**Common axis pairs:**
- Specialist ↔ Generalist × Premium ↔ Affordable
- Self-serve ↔ High-touch × Tactical ↔ Strategic
- Fast execution ↔ Deep thinking × Individual tools ↔ Integrated system

**Positioning Map Checklist:**
- [ ] Both axes represent real buyer priorities (not internal vanity metrics)
- [ ] At least 3 competitors plotted
- [ ] Your positioning quadrant is defensible
- [ ] The map tells a story about why your quadrant matters

### Category Design

Sometimes the right positioning isn't within an existing category — it's creating a new one.

**Signs you need a new category:**
- Existing categories don't capture what you do
- You're constantly explaining "we're like X but..."
- Competitors in your category have very different offerings
- Buyers don't know where to look for your solution

**Category creation requirements:**
1. Name the category (clear, memorable, self-explanatory)
2. Define the problem the category solves
3. Explain why existing categories don't solve it
4. Establish criteria for what belongs in this category
5. Position yourself as the obvious leader

**Caution:** Category creation is high-effort, high-risk. Most products are better served by positioning within an existing category with sharp differentiation.

### Competitive Response Framework

When a competitor makes a move (new feature, pricing change, positioning shift):

1. **Assess impact:** Does this affect our positioning or our customers?
2. **Determine response level:**
   - **Ignore:** They're not in our space or this doesn't affect us
   - **Monitor:** Worth watching, no action needed yet
   - **Address:** Update battle cards and messaging
   - **Counter:** Proactive messaging to reinforce our differentiation
3. **Update materials:** Battle cards, competitive messaging, and team talking points
4. **Don't overreact:** Most competitor moves don't require a response. Stay focused on your own positioning.

## Audience-to-Product-Decision Mapping

Product marketing informs product decisions — not just external messaging. This framework connects market segments to roadmap priorities.

### Segment Scoring Matrix

Score each audience segment on:

| Criterion | Weight | Score (1-5) |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Market size | High | How large is this segment? |
| Willingness to pay | High | Do they have budget and urgency? |
| Product fit | Medium | How well does current product serve them? |
| Acquisition cost | Medium | How expensive to reach and convert? |
| Strategic value | Medium | Does serving them open adjacent markets? |
| Competitive intensity | Low | How many competitors target this segment? |

**Prioritize segments with high scores on the high-weight criteria.** A large segment that's willing to pay and fits your product well is almost always worth pursuing, even if acquisition costs are moderate.

### From Segments to Roadmap

Once segments are prioritized:

1. **Map unmet needs per segment** — What does each segment need that you don't offer?
2. **Identify shared needs** — Which needs appear across multiple priority segments?
3. **Score features by segment impact** — Will this feature serve one segment or many?
4. **Recommend roadmap priorities** — Features that serve multiple priority segments rank highest

### Feedback Loop

Product marketing should feed back to product teams regularly:

| Signal | Source | Product Implication |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Prospects asking for features you don't have | Conversations, lost deals | Gap in product for this segment |
| Messaging that doesn't resonate | A/B tests, conversion data | Product-market fit may be off |
| Competitor winning a segment | Win/loss analysis | Evaluate competitive feature gap |
| Case study outcomes | Post-engagement reviews | Validate or update positioning claims |

## Launch Positioning Framework

When bringing something new to market (product, feature, service), the positioning work has specific requirements.

### Pre-Launch Positioning Checklist

- [ ] Market category defined (existing or new)
- [ ] Target audience identified and prioritized
- [ ] Competitive landscape mapped
- [ ] Positioning statement written and tested
- [ ] Messaging framework complete
- [ ] Proof points identified (even if early/limited)
- [ ] Success metrics defined

### Launch Messaging Tiers

**Tier 1: Core (must have before launch)**
- Positioning statement
- Primary and secondary messages
- Landing page copy
- One-liner for conversations

**Tier 2: Support (within first week)**
- Case study or early proof point
- Competitive battle cards
- FAQ for common questions

**Tier 3: Amplification (ongoing)**
- Thought leadership content aligned to positioning
- Customer testimonials and expanded case studies
- Evolved messaging based on market response

### Post-Launch Positioning Review

Within 30 days of launch:
1. **What messaging resonated?** (conversion data, conversation feedback)
2. **What didn't land?** (low engagement, confusion, wrong audience responding)
3. **What questions keep coming up?** (messaging gaps)
4. **How did competitors respond?** (need for counter-positioning?)
5. **Should positioning evolve?** (based on real market response, not internal opinion)
