# Go-to-Market Planning

Go-to-market planning is the bridge between building a product and getting it into the hands of the right people. It answers the strategic questions that come after "what should we build?" and before "how do we scale?" — pricing, channels, launch sequencing, adoption motions, and competitive positioning.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Market before motion.** Understand who you're reaching, where they are, and what alternatives they have before designing how to reach them. Strategy first, execution second.

2. **Sell the outcome, not the process.** Customers don't buy features or deliverables. They buy clarity, speed, and leverage. Frame everything in terms of what they get.

3. **Price anchors confidence.** Don't apologize for pricing. Premium positioning attracts premium customers. Pricing is a strategic decision, not a cost calculation.

4. **Qualify hard, early.** The worst outcome is acquiring the wrong customers. Better to say no fast than invest in a misaligned segment.

5. **Channels follow customers.** Don't start with "we should be on LinkedIn." Start with "where do our best customers already spend time and make decisions?"

6. **Launch is a moment, adoption is a motion.** Getting attention at launch is necessary but insufficient. Plan the full arc from awareness to activated, retained user.

7. **Scarcity only if real.** If you have limited capacity or availability windows, communicate honestly. Don't manufacture urgency.

### Industry Principles

8. **Research before committing.** Know the market, the competition, and the customer before locking in a GTM approach. Assumptions kill GTM plans.

9. **Distribution is the product.** How a product reaches customers is as important as what it does. The best product with the wrong distribution loses to a good product with great distribution.

10. **Test small, scale what works.** Don't over-invest in a channel or motion until you've validated it. Run cheap experiments, measure signal, then invest.

11. **Competitive positioning is relative.** You're always positioning against something — competitors, the status quo, or doing nothing. Make the comparison explicit.

12. **Track and learn.** Know your conversion rates, your cost-per-acquisition, your activation metrics. Iterate on what the data shows, not what feels right.

## Workflow

> Follow the [Workflow Orchestration Pattern](../../frameworks/workflow-orchestration.md) for the universal workflow approach. Below are the go-to-market planning-specific details for each step.

### 1. Clarify Before Starting

Before any GTM planning work, answer:

- **What stage?** Pre-launch, launch, growth, expansion?
- **What's launching?** New product, new feature, new market, new segment?
- **Who's the target?** Which ICP segments, prioritized?
- **What's the competitive landscape?** Who else serves this audience?
- **What's the business model?** How will this generate revenue?
- **What's the timeline?** When does this need to be in market?

### 2. Load Relevant Context

**Core context (always load):**
- `core/identity.md` — Services, positioning, terminology
- `core/voice.md` — Tone, language rules

**Extended context (load for GTM planning):**
- `extended/pricing.md` — Service tiers, scope, pricing philosophy
- `extended/icp.md` — Ideal client profile, qualification criteria

**Load when needed:**
- [GTM Fundamentals](references/gtm-fundamentals.md) — GTM motions, launch frameworks, channel evaluation

### 3. Choose the Right GTM Motion

| Motion | Best For | Key Characteristics |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Product-led | Self-serve products, developer tools | Free trial/freemium, low-touch onboarding, viral loops |
| Sales-led | Enterprise, high ACV | Outbound, discovery calls, demos, proposals |
| Community-led | Developer tools, niche markets | Content, community building, ecosystem, word-of-mouth |
| Partner-led | Platform products, marketplaces | Integrations, co-selling, partner programs |
| Content-led | Thought leadership, consulting | Authority content, inbound, trust-building |

Most products use a **hybrid motion** — a primary motion with supporting channels. Choose the primary based on your product's price point, complexity, and buyer behavior.

## GTM Planning Areas

### Launch Planning

**Purpose:** Coordinate how a product, feature, or service reaches the market for the first time.

**Pre-Launch (4-8 weeks before):**
1. Finalize positioning and messaging (use Product Marketing skill)
2. Identify launch channels and sequence
3. Build launch assets (landing page, announcement, documentation)
4. Set success metrics and measurement plan
5. Brief the team — everyone should be able to explain what's launching and why

**Launch Week:**
1. Execute channel plan in sequence (don't blast everything at once)
2. Monitor metrics in real-time (sign-ups, traffic, engagement)
3. Respond to feedback quickly (first 48 hours set the tone)
4. Document what's working and what isn't

**Post-Launch (2-4 weeks after):**
1. Measure against success metrics
2. Identify what resonated and what fell flat
3. Transition from launch mode to growth mode
4. Feed learnings back into positioning and product

**Launch Sequencing:**

| Phase | Audience | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Soft launch** | Existing users, beta testers | Validate, get early feedback, build proof |
| **Warm launch** | Network, existing audience | Generate initial momentum, referrals |
| **Public launch** | Target market broadly | Drive awareness and acquisition |

### Pricing Strategy

**Purpose:** Define how the product is priced, packaged, and positioned relative to value delivered.

**Pricing Framework:**

| Approach | When to Use | Characteristics |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Value-based | Product delivers measurable ROI | Price based on customer value, not cost |
| Competitive | Established market with alternatives | Priced relative to competition |
| Cost-plus | Commoditized, low differentiation | Price covers costs + margin |
| Penetration | New market, need adoption | Low initial price, raise later |
| Premium | Differentiated, high value | High price signals quality |

**Packaging Decisions:**

1. **Tiers:** How many tiers? What's in each? What drives upgrades?
2. **Bundling:** Which features bundle together? What's add-on vs. core?
3. **Usage vs. seat-based:** How does the customer think about value?
4. **Free tier / trial:** Does a free option accelerate or cannibalize adoption?

**Pricing Principles:**
- Price reflects value delivered, not effort expended
- State pricing confidently — no hedging, no apologizing
- Discuss pricing early in conversations — no surprises
- Hold price, adjust scope if needed — discounting attracts the wrong customers
- Test pricing with real customers, not just internal consensus

### Channel Strategy

**Purpose:** Determine where and how the product reaches target customers.

**Channel Evaluation Framework:**

For each potential channel, assess:

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Audience fit | Are your target customers actually here? |
| Cost | What's the acquisition cost through this channel? |
| Scalability | Can this channel grow with you? |
| Speed | How quickly can you see results? |
| Defensibility | Can competitors easily replicate your channel advantage? |
| Control | How much do you control the customer relationship? |

**Channel Types:**

| Channel | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Direct (website, outbound) | Full control, direct relationship | Requires building audience |
| Content/SEO | Compounds over time, builds authority | Slow to start, requires consistency |
| Partnerships | Leverages existing audiences | Less control, revenue sharing |
| Community | High trust, word-of-mouth | Slow to build, hard to measure |
| Paid (ads) | Fast, scalable, measurable | Expensive, stops when you stop spending |
| Events | High-touch, relationship building | Expensive, doesn't scale easily |

**Channel Mix Principles:**
- Start with 1-2 channels, master them, then expand
- Owned channels (website, email, content) are the foundation
- Paid channels accelerate but don't replace organic
- Measure by customer quality, not just quantity

### Distribution Planning

**Purpose:** Design how the product physically (or digitally) gets into users' hands.

**Distribution Models:**

| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Direct | Sell directly to end users | High-touch, premium, relationship-driven |
| Self-serve | Users sign up and onboard themselves | Low-touch, developer tools, low ACV |
| Marketplace | Listed on a platform (app store, marketplace) | Discovery-dependent, platform ecosystems |
| Reseller/Partner | Sold through third parties | Geographic expansion, enterprise, regulated |
| Open source / freemium | Free distribution, paid conversion | Developer tools, platform plays |

**Distribution Checklist:**
- [ ] How does the customer discover the product?
- [ ] How do they evaluate it (demo, trial, content)?
- [ ] How do they purchase (self-serve, sales, partner)?
- [ ] How do they get started (onboarding, implementation)?
- [ ] How do they get help (support, documentation, community)?
- [ ] How do they expand usage (upsell, cross-sell)?

### Adoption Strategy

**Purpose:** Plan the full arc from first contact to activated, retained user.

**The Adoption Arc:**

```
AWARENESS → ACQUISITION → ACTIVATION → RETENTION → EXPANSION → ADVOCACY
```

| Stage | Question | Key Metric |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Awareness | Do they know we exist? | Reach, impressions, traffic |
| Acquisition | Did they sign up / start? | Sign-ups, trial starts |
| Activation | Did they get value quickly? | Time-to-value, activation rate |
| Retention | Do they keep coming back? | Retention rate, churn |
| Expansion | Are they using more? | Upsell rate, seat expansion |
| Advocacy | Are they telling others? | NPS, referrals, reviews |

**Activation is the critical stage.** Most GTM plans over-index on awareness and acquisition but under-invest in activation. A user who signs up but never gets value is worse than a user who never signs up — they've had a negative experience.

**Activation Design:**
1. Define the "aha moment" — what's the first moment of real value?
2. Measure time-to-value — how long until they experience it?
3. Remove friction between sign-up and aha moment
4. Design onboarding to accelerate time-to-value
5. Set activation metrics and track them obsessively

**Retention Principles:**
- Retention starts at activation — users who activate well retain better
- Understand why people leave before trying to prevent it
- Habitual use patterns beat one-time value
- Re-engagement is harder than engagement — invest upstream

### Competitive Positioning

**Purpose:** Position the product relative to alternatives in the market.

**Competitive Landscape Map:**
1. Identify all alternatives (direct competitors, adjacent solutions, status quo)
2. Map on relevant dimensions (see Product Marketing skill for positioning maps)
3. Identify your defensible quadrant
4. Craft messaging that highlights differentiation

**Competitive Response Principles:**
- Acknowledge competitor strengths — denying obvious strengths erodes credibility
- Focus on what's provable and specific — not superlatives
- Position against the category, not individual competitors (when possible)
- Update competitive analysis quarterly — landscapes shift

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Instead |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Build it and they will come** | No distribution plan | Plan distribution before building |
| **All channels at once** | Spread too thin, nothing works | Master 1-2 channels, then expand |
| **Launch and forget** | No adoption arc | Plan awareness through advocacy |
| **Pricing by cost** | Leaves value on the table | Price by customer value delivered |
| **Ignoring competition** | Blindsided by alternatives | Map the landscape, position clearly |
| **Over-indexing on acquisition** | Users sign up but don't activate | Invest equally in activation and retention |
| **Discounting to win** | Attracts wrong customers, erodes positioning | Hold price, adjust scope |

## When to Escalate

Flag for review when:

- GTM strategy represents a significant market shift
- Pricing changes affect existing customers
- Channel strategy requires significant investment or partnerships
- Competitive dynamics have shifted materially
- Launch timing conflicts with other business priorities
- Adoption metrics suggest product-market fit issues
- Distribution partnerships require legal or contractual review
