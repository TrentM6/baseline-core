## GTM Motion Types

Every product needs a primary GTM motion — the dominant way it reaches customers. The motion is determined by product complexity, price point, and buyer behavior.

### Product-Led Growth (PLG)

**How it works:** The product itself drives acquisition, activation, and expansion. Users try the product before buying. Usage data drives conversion.

**Characteristics:**
- Free tier or trial as the entry point
- Self-serve onboarding (no sales team required to start)
- Usage-based or seat-based pricing
- Viral loops or network effects accelerate growth
- Data-driven conversion (usage triggers upgrade prompts)

**Best for:**
- Developer tools, productivity software, collaboration tools
- Low complexity, intuitive UI
- ACV under $10K (for initial land)
- Products where trying IS understanding

**Key metrics:** Sign-up to activation rate, time-to-value, free-to-paid conversion, expansion revenue

**PLG Pitfalls:**
- Over-optimizing for free users who never convert
- Ignoring enterprise needs (security, compliance, admin)
- Assuming product quality alone drives growth (still need marketing)

### Sales-Led Growth

**How it works:** Sales team drives acquisition through outbound prospecting, inbound qualification, demos, and proposals.

**Characteristics:**
- Outbound and/or inbound pipeline
- Discovery calls, demos, proposals
- Longer sales cycles (weeks to months)
- Relationship-driven, high-touch
- Account-based strategies for enterprise

**Best for:**
- Enterprise products, high ACV ($50K+)
- Complex products requiring explanation
- Products where buying committee has multiple stakeholders
- Services, consulting, custom solutions

**Key metrics:** Pipeline volume, win rate, sales cycle length, CAC, LTV:CAC ratio

**Sales-Led Pitfalls:**
- Over-reliance on outbound (need inbound too)
- Selling before understanding (pitch before discovery)
- Long cycles without clear next steps
- Not qualifying hard enough (bad deals consume resources)

### Community-Led Growth

**How it works:** Community of users, practitioners, or enthusiasts drives awareness, trust, and adoption through shared knowledge and peer recommendations.

**Characteristics:**
- Forums, Slack/Discord groups, meetups, conferences
- User-generated content and peer support
- Thought leadership and ecosystem building
- Trust built through contribution, not selling

**Best for:**
- Developer tools, open source projects
- Niche markets with passionate practitioners
- Products where peer recommendation is critical
- Platforms where ecosystem matters

**Key metrics:** Community size, engagement rate, community-sourced leads, NPS

**Community-Led Pitfalls:**
- Trying to "build community" without genuine value exchange
- Over-moderating (kills authenticity)
- Treating community as a marketing channel instead of a relationship

### Content-Led Growth

**How it works:** Authority content drives inbound traffic, builds trust, and positions the company as the expert in their domain.

**Characteristics:**
- Blog posts, guides, research reports, frameworks
- SEO-driven traffic that compounds over time
- Thought leadership that builds trust before first conversation
- Content that educates the market, not just promotes the product

**Best for:**
- Consulting, services, knowledge-based businesses
- Markets where buyers research before buying
- Products with complex value propositions
- B2B where trust and expertise matter

**Key metrics:** Organic traffic, content-attributed pipeline, time-on-site, email subscribers

**Content-Led Pitfalls:**
- Publishing without strategy (content calendar without positioning)
- SEO without substance (ranking for terms that don't convert)
- Only creating awareness content (need consideration + conversion too)

### Hybrid Motions

Most successful GTM strategies are hybrid — a primary motion with supporting elements.

**Common Hybrids:**
- PLG + Sales-led: Free tier drives adoption, sales team handles enterprise expansion
- Content-led + Sales-led: Authority content generates inbound, sales team converts
- Community-led + PLG: Community builds trust, product trial converts
- Content-led + Community-led: Content attracts, community retains

**Choosing Your Hybrid:**
1. Start with your primary motion based on product and market
2. Identify the weakest point in your funnel
3. Add a supporting motion that addresses that weakness
4. Don't add more than 2 motions until the first 2 are working

## Launch Playbook Frameworks

### The Staged Launch

Most launches should be staged, not big-bang. Staged launches reduce risk, build proof, and create momentum.

**Stage 1: Internal (Week -4 to -2)**
- Team uses the product/feature internally
- Identify and fix critical issues
- Build internal confidence and talking points
- Create documentation

**Stage 2: Beta / Soft Launch (Week -2 to 0)**
- Invite select users (existing customers, design partners, beta testers)
- Gather feedback and testimonials
- Refine messaging based on real reactions
- Build initial proof points

**Stage 3: Warm Launch (Week 0 to +1)**
- Announce to existing audience (email list, social followers)
- Activate referral network
- Publish launch content (blog post, social, landing page)
- Monitor closely and respond fast

**Stage 4: Public Launch (Week +1 to +4)**
- Broader distribution (ads, PR, partner announcements)
- Content amplification
- Optimize based on what's working
- Transition to steady-state growth

### Launch Metrics Framework

Define these BEFORE launch, not after:

| Metric Category | Examples | When to Measure |
|----------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Awareness** | Traffic, impressions, mentions | Launch week |
| **Acquisition** | Sign-ups, trial starts, demo requests | First 2 weeks |
| **Activation** | Feature adoption, time-to-value | First 30 days |
| **Revenue** | Conversions, deal pipeline, ACV | First 30-60 days |
| **Sentiment** | NPS, feedback quality, support tickets | First 30 days |

### Launch Retrospective Template

Within 2 weeks of public launch:

1. **What worked?** (Keep doing)
2. **What didn't work?** (Stop or fix)
3. **What surprised us?** (Investigate)
4. **What would we do differently?** (Learn)
5. **What should we double down on?** (Invest)

## Channel Evaluation Framework

### Channel Scoring Matrix

Score each potential channel 1-5 on these dimensions:

| Dimension | 1 (Low) | 5 (High) |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Audience fit** | Our ICP isn't here | This is where our ICP lives |
| **Cost efficiency** | Expensive per acquisition | Low cost per quality lead |
| **Speed to results** | 6+ months to see signal | Results within weeks |
| **Scalability** | Maxes out quickly | Can grow with us for years |
| **Control** | Platform-dependent, no data | Own the relationship and data |
| **Compounding** | Stops when you stop | Builds on itself over time |

**Priority channels:** Score 20+ out of 30
**Test channels:** Score 15-20
**Avoid for now:** Score under 15

### Channel-to-Stage Mapping

Different channels work at different funnel stages:

| Funnel Stage | Best Channels | Why |
|-------------|---------------|-----|
| Awareness | Content, social, events, PR | Broad reach, trust-building |
| Consideration | Case studies, webinars, email | Depth, proof, nurturing |
| Conversion | Direct sales, landing pages, demos | Action-oriented, personal |
| Retention | Email, community, in-product | Ongoing value, habit-building |
| Expansion | Customer success, in-product | Relationship, usage signals |

## Adoption Metrics and Milestones

### Defining the Activation Moment

The activation moment is when a user first experiences real value. It's the most important metric in any GTM plan because it predicts retention.

**How to find your activation moment:**
1. Look at retained users — what actions did they take early that non-retained users didn't?
2. Identify the behavior that correlates with long-term retention
3. Define it precisely (e.g., "created first project and invited a teammate within 7 days")
4. Measure what percentage of new users hit this milestone

**Examples of activation moments:**
- Slack: Sent 2,000 messages as a team
- Dropbox: Uploaded first file
- Zoom: Completed first meeting
- Baseline: Ran first skill with loaded context

### Adoption Milestones

Track users through these milestones:

| Milestone | Definition | Target |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Signed up** | Created account or installed | Baseline |
| **Onboarded** | Completed setup/configuration | 80% of sign-ups within 1 week |
| **Activated** | Hit the activation moment | 40-60% of onboarded within 2 weeks |
| **Habitual** | Used 3+ times in 30 days | 60% of activated within 30 days |
| **Expanded** | Upgraded, added seats, or expanded usage | 20-30% of habitual within 90 days |
| **Advocate** | Referred others, left review, case study | 10-15% of habitual |

### Adoption Blockers

When adoption stalls, diagnose which stage is broken:

| Symptom | Likely Stage | Investigation |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Low sign-ups | Awareness/Acquisition | Channel reach, messaging resonance |
| Sign up but don't complete setup | Onboarding | Friction, clarity, time-to-value |
| Complete setup but don't return | Activation | Value not delivered, wrong aha moment |
| Use once but churn | Retention | No habit loop, insufficient value |
| Use regularly but don't expand | Expansion | No clear upgrade path, satisfaction plateau |

## Pricing Strategy Models

### Value-Based Pricing Framework

The most effective pricing model for differentiated products.

**Step 1: Quantify Customer Value**
- What does the customer gain from using your product?
- What would it cost them NOT to solve this problem?
- What alternatives exist and what do they cost?

**Step 2: Set Price as a Fraction of Value**
- Rule of thumb: Price at 10-20% of the value you deliver
- Customer keeps 80-90% of the value (makes the ROI obvious)
- Higher fraction is possible with strong differentiation and few alternatives

**Step 3: Validate**
- Test with real customer conversations (not surveys)
- Watch for: objection patterns, win rates, deal velocity
- Adjust based on signal, not internal opinion

### Packaging Models

| Model | How it Works | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Flat rate** | One price for everything | Simple products, clear value |
| **Tiered** | 2-4 tiers with feature gates | Products with clear user segments |
| **Usage-based** | Pay for what you use | Infrastructure, API products |
| **Seat-based** | Price per user | Collaboration tools, SaaS |
| **Outcome-based** | Price tied to results | Consulting, performance marketing |

### Pricing Presentation Principles

- **Anchor high.** Present the most expensive option first. The second option feels reasonable by comparison.
- **Make the middle tier the obvious choice.** Most buyers choose the middle. Design it as your ideal package.
- **Name tiers by persona, not size.** "Growth" and "Enterprise" are better than "Small" and "Large."
- **Show what's included, not excluded.** Positive framing converts better.
- **One CTA per tier.** Don't give them two buttons.
