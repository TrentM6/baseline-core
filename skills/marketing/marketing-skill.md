# Marketing

Marketing is about earning attention from the right people. Not broadcasting to everyone — attracting the specific clients who need what you offer through valuable content and clear positioning.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Sound like a peer, not a marketer.** Content should feel like advice from a senior operator, not a pitch from a vendor. If it reads like marketing, rewrite it.

2. **One insight per piece.** Don't cram. Each piece of content should deliver one clear, valuable idea that the reader can use.

3. **Prove, don't claim.** "10+ years shipping at scale" beats "experienced professional." Show evidence, not adjectives.

4. **Research-first positioning.** The same thinking you sell is in how you market. Figure out the problem before selling the solution.

5. **Direct access, direct voice.** If you're a solo operator, be one. "I" not "we." Personal, not corporate.

6. **Content compounds.** One great piece that gets shared beats ten mediocre posts. Quality over quantity, always.

7. **Scarcity is only real if it's real.** If you have limited capacity, mention it honestly without being salesy about it.

### Industry Principles

8. **Know your audience deeply.** What are they reading? What keeps them up at night? What language do they use?

9. **Meet them where they are.** LinkedIn for professional network. Twitter for thought leadership. Website for conversion.

10. **Consistency builds trust.** Regular presence (but not forced). Show up with value, not just visibility.

11. **Distribution matters as much as creation.** A post no one sees doesn't exist. Think about reach.

12. **Every piece has a job.** Awareness, engagement, or conversion. Know which before writing.

## Workflow

> Follow the [Workflow Orchestration Pattern](../../frameworks/workflow-orchestration.md) for the universal workflow approach. Below are the marketing-specific details for each step.

### 1. Clarify Before Starting

Before creating any marketing content, answer:

- **Goal:** Awareness, engagement, or conversion?
- **Audience:** Which buyer persona? What's their mindset?
- **Channel:** LinkedIn, website, email, Twitter?
- **Format:** Post, article, case study, landing page?
- **Key message:** What's the one thing they should take away?
- **CTA:** What should they do after consuming this?

**For pipeline/calendar tasks, also ask:**
- **Time horizon:** 30, 60, or 90 days?
- **Cadence:** How often per channel?
- **Content creators:** Who's producing what?
- **Source piece:** (For repurposing) What's the source material?

### 2. Load Relevant Context

**Core context (always load):**
- `core/identity.md` — Services, positioning, proof points, terminology
- `core/voice.md` — Tone, style, language guidelines

**Extended context (load for marketing):**
- `extended/icp.md` — Ideal client profile, personas, what they care about

**Load when needed:**
- [Content Playbooks](references/content-playbooks.md) — Detailed templates for specific content types

### 3. Choose the Right Approach

**By Content Goal:**

| Goal | Approach | Framework |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Awareness | Thought leadership, insights | Hook → Value → CTA |
| Engagement | Deep posts, articles, discussions | Value-first, invite response |
| Conversion | Landing pages, sales pages | AIDA or PAS |

**By Channel:**

| Channel | Best For | Constraints |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| LinkedIn | Professional audience, B2B | 150-200 words, hook matters |
| Twitter/X | Quick takes, threads | Brevity, strong hook |
| Website | Converting visitors | AIDA structure, clear CTA |
| Email | Nurturing, announcements | Subject line, one idea |

### Content Pipeline Tasks

When the task involves planning content (calendars, repurposing, pillar strategy) rather than writing a single piece:

| Task | Load | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| Editorial calendar | `content-strategy.md` + `proof-points.md` | Pillars, personas, pipeline mapping |
| Content repurposing | `content-strategy.md` + `content-playbooks.md` | Repurposing chain + format-specific templates |
| Single content piece | `content-playbooks.md` + `proof-points.md` | Template + evidence |
| Pillar strategy / audit | `content-strategy.md` | Pillar definitions and balance checks |
| Competitive content scan | `content-strategy.md` + `competitive.md` + Chrome MCP | Scan competitor blogs, identify gaps and opportunities |

### 4. Draft and Refine

**First Draft:**
- Write fast, don't self-edit
- Get the core idea down
- Don't worry about word count yet

**Refinement Pass:**
- Cut ruthlessly (can I say this in fewer words?)
- Check voice (does this sound like the brand?)
- Verify claims (can I back this up?)
- Run 4Cs filter (Clear, Concise, Compelling, Credible)

**Final Check:**
- Read aloud — does it flow?
- First line test — would this make someone stop scrolling?
- 5-second test — is the main point obvious?

## Content Types

### LinkedIn Posts

**Purpose:** Awareness, thought leadership, stay top of mind
**Length:** 150-200 words (see content-playbooks.md for full LinkedIn specs)

**What works:**
- Observations from real work (anonymized if needed)
- Contrarian takes with substance
- Frameworks or mental models
- "Here's what I learned" narratives
- Industry trends with a point of view

**What doesn't work:**
- "Excited to announce..." posts
- Vague inspirational content
- Reposting without adding value
- Pure self-promotion without value

**Structure:** Hook → Value → CTA (usually soft)

### Website Copy

**Purpose:** Convert visitors to conversations
**Key pages:** Home, Services, About, Case Studies

**Principles:**
- Every section earns the next scroll
- Benefits before features
- Proof points throughout (specific, not vague)
- One primary CTA per page
- Scannable (headers, short paragraphs)

### Case Studies

**Purpose:** Prove outcomes, build credibility
**Length:** 500-800 words

**Structure:**
1. Client snapshot (context without naming if needed)
2. Challenge (what they faced)
3. Approach (what was done)
4. Results (outcomes, metrics)
5. Key insight (what was learned)

**Principles:**
- Focus on outcomes, not process heroics
- Include specific metrics where possible
- Let the transformation tell the story

### Email Campaigns

**Purpose:** Nurture, engage, convert
**Types:** Welcome sequence, re-engagement, announcements

**Principles:**
- Subject line earns the open
- First line earns the read
- One idea per email
- Clear CTA
- Easy to unsubscribe

**Welcome sequence structure:**
1. Confirmation + set expectations
2. Quick win / value delivery
3. Story / why this matters
4. Social proof / case study
5. Offer / CTA

### Landing Pages & Sales Pages

**Purpose:** Convert visitors to leads or customers
**Use:** Lead magnets, product launches, service pages

**Structure (AIDA/PAS hybrid):**
1. Hero: Bold headline, clear value prop, primary CTA
2. Problem: Acknowledge the pain they're feeling
3. Agitation: Make it feel urgent (cost of inaction)
4. Solution: Introduce your answer
5. Benefits: What they get (outcomes, not features)
6. Proof: Testimonials, case studies, logos
7. Objections: Address common concerns
8. CTA: Repeat the action
9. Guarantee: Reduce risk (if applicable)

**Conversion copy principles:**
- One job per page — know the single action you want
- Benefits before features — what does it mean for them?
- Specificity creates credibility — "50,000 users" beats "many users"
- Address objections before they become reasons to leave
- Every word earns its place — if you can cut it, cut it

**Headlines that work:**

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Benefit-first | "Ship products 10x faster" |
| Problem-agitate | "Still shipping the wrong features?" |
| How-to | "How to validate ideas before building" |
| Question | "What if your roadmap is the problem?" |
| Social proof | "Why 500+ teams switched" |

**CTAs that convert:**

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| Submit | Send message |
| Click here | Download the guide |
| Learn more | See how it works |
| Sign up | Start your free trial |

**Reducing friction:**
- "Start free trial" (no commitment language)
- "Takes 2 minutes"
- "No credit card required"
- "Cancel anytime"

### Editorial Calendar

**Purpose:** Prioritized content plan across channels, pillars, and personas
**Scope:** 30, 60, or 90 days

**Each entry includes:** Topic, format, pillar, target persona, key proof points, creator, job (awareness/engagement/conversion)

**Process:** Follow the editorial calendar generation methodology in `content-strategy.md`. Validate with Pipeline Quality checks below.

### Content Repurposing Package

**Purpose:** Turn one substantial piece into multiple channel-specific assets
**Input:** Source material (case study, whitepaper, client outcome, engagement summary)

**Output set:** LinkedIn post + blog draft + email excerpt + talking points. Optionally: LinkedIn carousel, blog pull quotes for social, email nurture sequence.

**Process:** Follow the repurposing chain in `content-strategy.md`. Each derivative adapts voice and depth for its channel — never copy-paste across formats. Anonymization from the source carries to all derivatives.

## When to Escalate

Flag for review when:

- Content makes claims about outcomes that aren't documented
- Mentioning specific clients by name (need approval)
- Pricing or scope statements in public content
- Controversial or potentially polarizing takes
- Content that will be widely distributed (ads, PR)
- Testimonial quotes or client statements
- Anything that deviates significantly from brand voice
