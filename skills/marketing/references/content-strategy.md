## Content Pillars

Every piece of Baseline content maps to one of these five pillars. Each pillar has a clear thesis, target personas, and proof points to draw from.

### Pillar 1: The Research-First Advantage

**Thesis:** Most product teams skip research and ship fast in the wrong direction. The teams that win invest in understanding before building. Research isn't a luxury — it's the highest-leverage activity a product team can do.

**Key Messages:**
- Speed without direction is just expensive guessing
- AI makes research 10x faster — there's no excuse to skip it anymore
- The teams that research first ship fewer things, but the right things
- "Move fast and break things" breaks down at scale. Research-first compounds

**Target Personas:** Head of Product (feels this daily — shipping without confidence), CEO/Founder (board asking why launches underperform)

**Proof Points:**
- Baseline client outcomes: product redesign ready for enterprise sales, funding round closed based on new positioning
- ListenLabs AI-powered research: interviews and synthesis in days, not weeks
- Industry: most product failures are demand-side, not supply-side

**Content Angles:**
- "The most expensive thing your product team does is build the wrong thing"
- "Research in days, not weeks: how AI changed the equation"
- "Why your roadmap feels like guessing (and what to do about it)"
- "The research step everyone skips — and the cost of skipping it"

---

### Pillar 2: AI Workflows That Actually Ship

**Thesis:** Everyone's talking about AI. Most teams are using it for surface-level tasks — a chatbot here, some generated copy there. The gap between AI experimentation and AI that fundamentally changes how a team works is where real value lives. It requires systems, not just tools.

**Key Messages:**
- AI tools without workflows are just expensive toys
- The difference between AI adoption and AI impact is a system
- The Baseline System gives teams a framework that compounds — skills, context, scripts, and frameworks working together
- You don't need more AI tools. You need a system that makes the tools work together

**Target Personas:** CEO/Founder (sees competitors using AI, knows team should do more), Head of Product (team is "using AI" but nothing has fundamentally changed), COO/Head of Ops (wants systems that scale)

**Proof Points:**
- The Baseline System: 12 skills, cross-platform delivery (Figma, Confluence, Asana, Slack)
- CodeTogether engagement: complete product redesign using AI-powered workflows
- AI workflows since 2022 — proven systems, not experiments
- Client teams own the system after engagement ends

**Content Angles:**
- "Your team uses AI. But has anything actually changed?"
- "The difference between AI tools and AI workflows"
- "Why 'just use ChatGPT' isn't an AI strategy"
- "What an AI workflow system actually looks like (not what you think)"
- "AI adoption vs. AI impact: where most teams get stuck"

---

### Pillar 3: Senior Operator > Agency Model

**Thesis:** The traditional model of hiring agencies for product work is broken. Too many layers, too many handoffs, too much cost, and the work doesn't stick. One senior operator who scopes it, does it, and owns it delivers more value than a team of juniors managed by account managers.

**Key Messages:**
- Agency experience, none of the bloat
- Direct access to the person doing the work — no account managers, no handoffs
- 10+ years shipping at scale, not a freelancer learning on your dime
- The work compounds because frameworks outlast the engagement

**Target Personas:** CEO/Founder (burned by agencies, skeptical of consultants), Head of Product (needs senior-level thinking, not junior execution), COO (wants efficiency and accountability)

**Proof Points:**
- Past clients: NIQ, CodeTogether, Cox Automotive, 3Pillar, UpScriptHealth
- 10+ years in product at Fortune 500 and high-growth startups
- CodeTogether: funding round closed, enterprise pipeline built, product redesigned
- Engagement model: 1-week research sprints, 4-6 week AI workflow implementations

**Content Angles:**
- "What you'd get from a top firm, delivered by one senior operator"
- "Why I left agency work (and what clients actually need)"
- "The solo operator model: less overhead, more impact"
- "Agencies vs. operators: where the work actually gets done"

---

### Pillar 4: Product Clarity Before Speed

**Thesis:** The bottleneck has shifted. Building isn't the slow part anymore — AI handles that. Knowing what to build, what users need, what to cut, and what's worth the investment is the real constraint. Teams that get clarity first ship fewer things but ship the right things.

**Key Messages:**
- In 2020, building was the slow part. Now AI generates interfaces in hours. The constraint is direction
- More headcount doesn't solve a direction problem
- The teams that invest in clarity before speed outperform every time
- Validation testing before full build saves 10x the cost of shipping the wrong thing

**Target Personas:** Head of Product (feels pressure to ship but isn't confident in direction), CEO/Founder (board meeting where they couldn't articulate the roadmap), COO (team is busy but leadership can't tell if real progress is happening)

**Proof Points:**
- Baseline's research & validation service: clarity in 1 week
- The trigger moment: "Do we need another designer, or do we need to figure out what we're building?"
- Client pattern: teams that tried "move faster" before trying "move smarter"

**Content Angles:**
- "The bottleneck has shifted — and most teams haven't noticed"
- "Your team isn't slow. They're building the wrong things"
- "Clarity before speed: the counterintuitive path to shipping faster"
- "Why hiring more people won't fix your product velocity"
- "The question I ask every new client (and why it changes everything)"

---

### Pillar 5: One System, Every Team

**Thesis:** AI implementation shouldn't be bespoke every time. The Baseline System is built once — skills, frameworks, context, scripts — and deployed to any team by swapping context. Teams own the system after the engagement ends. It scales, it compounds, and it works across tools and platforms.

**Key Messages:**
- Build the system once, deploy it everywhere by swapping context
- Skills are universal — research, design, strategy, marketing — they work for any team
- Scripts push outputs directly to the tools teams already use
- The system grows with the team — add examples, extend context, request new skills
- Clients own everything. No vendor lock-in, no subscription

**Target Personas:** CEO/Founder (wants a system that outlasts the engagement), COO/Head of Ops (wants scalable process), Head of Product (wants frameworks the team will actually adopt)

**Proof Points:**
- 12 universal skills covering the full product lifecycle
- Cross-platform delivery: Figma, Confluence, Asana, Slack via MCP
- System architecture: skills + context + frameworks + scripts
- Client ownership: Obsidian for management, GitHub for version control

**Content Angles:**
- "What an AI system for product teams actually looks like"
- "Why every AI implementation shouldn't start from scratch"
- "The system your team keeps using after the consultant leaves"
- "Skills, context, frameworks, scripts: the four pieces of an AI workflow system"

## Editorial Calendar Generation

Step-by-step methodology for generating a prioritized content calendar.

### Inputs Required

1. **Time horizon** — How many weeks/months to plan (typically 30, 60, or 90 days)
2. **Content cadence** — How often per channel (e.g., 2 LinkedIn posts/week, 1 blog/month)
3. **Content creators** — Who's producing what (typically Trent for all Baseline content)
4. **Current priorities** — Any active campaigns, service launches, events, or sales motions to support
5. **Recent content audit** — What's been published recently to avoid repetition

### Process

**Step 1: Pillar Balance Check**
Review the last 30 days of content. Which pillars are overrepresented? Which are underserved? Aim for roughly equal coverage across pillars over any 30-day period, with heavier weight on pillars that align with current business priorities.

**Step 2: ICP Pain Point Mapping**
Cross-reference each pillar's content angles against the ICP's top priorities:
- Capacity pressure without clear direction (Pillars 1, 4)
- Board/market pressure to execute (Pillars 2, 4)
- Burned by agencies, skeptical of consultants (Pillar 3)
- AI adoption that hasn't changed anything (Pillar 2)
- Need for scalable systems (Pillar 5)

Prioritize angles that hit the highest-urgency ICP pain points first.

**Step 3: Competitive Content Scan**
Check what competitors and adjacent players are publishing. Use Chrome MCP or web search to visit competitor blogs and resource pages. Summarize recent themes, then identify gaps Baseline can own.

**Sites to check:**

| Competitor Type | Examples | What to look for |
|----------------|---------|------------------|
| Product consultancies | Thoughtbot, Product Board advisors | Themes, service positioning, case studies, AI messaging |
| AI implementation shops | Various | How they position AI workflows, what they claim to deliver |
| Solo operators / fractional CPOs | LinkedIn thought leaders | Content topics, engagement patterns, positioning angles |
| Agencies | Digital product agencies | Their pain points (which validate Pillar 3) |

**LinkedIn (manual input):** LinkedIn doesn't allow automated scraping. If you have recent competitor LinkedIn posts to analyze, paste them into the session. Otherwise skip this — blog content is the higher-signal source.

**Scan checklist:**
- What topics are competitors pushing this month?
- Are any competitors entering Baseline's strongest angles (research-first, AI systems, solo operator model)?
- Where are the content gaps — topics nobody is covering that Baseline can credibly own?
- Any new case studies, product launches, or positioning shifts to be aware of?
- Are competitors making claims that Baseline's proof points can directly counter?

**Output:** A brief competitive content summary (5-10 bullets) that informs calendar prioritization. Don't over-invest — this is a 10-minute scan, not a research project.

**Step 4: Seasonal and Trigger Alignment**
Map content to business calendar triggers:
- **Q1:** Budget planning, new year goals → AI investment content, "start the year right" content
- **Q2:** Execution, mid-year reviews → Product clarity content, research-first content
- **Q3:** Strategic reviews, mid-year course corrections → System and process content
- **Q4:** Planning, board presentations → ROI content, year-in-review data

Also map to buying triggers: new Head of Product hires, recent fundraising rounds, failed product launches, board pressure on product velocity, "we need an AI strategy" conversations.

**Step 5: Fill the Calendar**
For each slot in the calendar, assign:
- **Topic** — Specific angle from a pillar
- **Format** — LinkedIn post, blog, email, case study derivative, etc.
- **Pillar** — Which content pillar it belongs to
- **Target Persona** — Primary audience for this piece
- **Key Proof Points** — Which proof points to reference (cite by name from proof-points.md)
- **Creator** — Who writes or reviews this piece
- **Job** — Awareness, engagement, or conversion

**Step 6: Validate**
Run the Pipeline Quality checks (defined in the marketing skill's quality section) before finalizing.

## Content Repurposing Chain

One substantial piece of work becomes many content assets. The chain works in both directions — you can start from any node and produce the others.

### The Chain

```
Source Material (case study, engagement summary, blog post, framework)
    ↓
Insight Extraction — Pull 3-5 key data points, quotes, or findings
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                         │
↓                    ↓                    ↓               ↓
LinkedIn Post    Blog Draft         Email Excerpt    Talking Points
(1 insight,      (800-1200 words,   (1 data point,   (For Trent,
 150-200 words)   pillar-aligned)    one CTA)         verbal use)
│                    │                    │
↓                    ↓                    ↓
LinkedIn Carousel  Blog Pull Quotes   Email Sequence
(3-5 data points)  (for social)       (nurture series)
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Repurposing Rules

1. **Every insight gets at least 3 formats.** If it's worth saying once, it's worth saying in multiple contexts
2. **Adapt, don't copy-paste.** Each format has its own voice. A LinkedIn post is punchy and personal. A blog is structured and evidence-heavy. An email is direct and action-oriented
3. **Respect the channel.** LinkedIn audiences scan. Blog readers go deeper. Email recipients decide in the subject line
4. **Track the chain.** When creating content, note which source material it came from and which derivative formats have been produced. This prevents both duplication and missed opportunities
5. **Anonymize consistently.** If the source requires anonymization (client data), every derivative must also be anonymized. Check proof-points.md status fields

### Example: Client Engagement → Content Chain

**Source:** CodeTogether engagement outcomes
**Extracted Insights:**
- Complete product redesign ready for enterprise sales
- Sales pipeline populated with qualified enterprise prospects
- Funding round closed based on new positioning

**Derivatives:**
- **LinkedIn Post:** "A dev tools company came to me with a great product and no enterprise pipeline. 4 months later, they closed a funding round." (Pillar 3)
- **Blog Draft:** "From Product-Led to Enterprise-Ready: What Actually Changes" (Pillar 1 + 4)
- **Email:** Subject: "The product redesign that closed a funding round" → one outcome, link to blog
- **Talking Points for Trent:** "One of my clients came in with a strong product but no enterprise motion. We redesigned the product, rebuilt the positioning, and they closed a funding round on the back of it."

## Thought Leadership Framework

How to position Baseline's voice in the market.

### Voice Roster

| Voice | Role | Topics They Own | Angle |
|-------|------|-----------------|-------|
| **Trent** | Founder & Senior Operator | Research-first product work, AI workflows that actually ship, the solo operator advantage, why clarity beats speed, building systems not just deliverables | The practitioner. Speaks from hands-on experience. Makes the complex accessible without dumbing it down. Challenges conventional wisdom with evidence |

### Personal Voice vs. Brand Voice

| Dimension | Brand Voice | Personal Voice |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Tone** | Calm, credible, benefit-forward | Personal, opinionated, experience-based |
| **Perspective** | "Baseline provides..." | "I've seen..." / "What I've learned..." |
| **Evidence** | Case study metrics, engagement outcomes | Pattern recognition from client conversations, industry observation |
| **CTA** | "Book a conversation" / "See how it works" | "What are you seeing?" / "I'd like to hear your take" |
| **Best for** | Website, documentation, service descriptions | LinkedIn posts, conference talks, media interviews |

### Thought Leadership Principles

1. **Lead with the question, not the answer.** The best thought leadership makes people think. Pose the problem before offering the perspective
2. **Earn the right to opine.** Every opinion should be grounded in evidence or direct experience. "I've seen this pattern across [X] engagements" is credible. "I believe" without backing is not
3. **Own the narrative gap.** Baseline's strongest thought leadership angles are ones competitors can't credibly claim: research-first AI workflows, the solo senior operator model, systems that teams own after the engagement
4. **Be useful, not promotional.** If a reader walks away smarter regardless of whether they hire Baseline, the content succeeded
5. **Respect the audience.** Product leaders are sophisticated buyers. Don't oversimplify, don't hype, don't condescend

## Content-to-Pipeline Mapping

Which content types feed the sales pipeline and how.

### The Funnel

```
AWARENESS (they know the problem exists)
│
│  Content types: LinkedIn thought leadership, blog posts, industry commentary
│  Job: Make them recognize the problem. Introduce Baseline's perspective
│  Metrics: Impressions, engagement, profile visits, website traffic
│  Proof points to use: Industry observations, general claims, frameworks
│
├──────────────────────────────────────────
│
CONSIDERATION (they're evaluating solutions)
│
│  Content types: Case studies, service deep-dives, process breakdowns
│  Job: Show that Baseline solves it. Differentiate from agencies and freelancers
│  Metrics: Website time-on-page, content saves, DM conversations, intro requests
│  Proof points to use: Named client outcomes, engagement timelines, system overview
│
├──────────────────────────────────────────
│
CONVERSION (they're ready to decide)
│
│  Content types: Service pages, engagement proposals, direct conversations
│  Job: Make the business case. Remove remaining objections
│  Metrics: Discovery calls, proposals sent, engagements started
│  Proof points to use: Specific engagement outcomes, pricing clarity, client references
│
└──────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Content Type → Pipeline Stage

| Content Type | Pipeline Stage | Primary Job | Secondary Job |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| LinkedIn post (insight) | Awareness | Introduce perspective | Drive to blog/website |
| LinkedIn post (proof) | Awareness → Consideration | Show outcomes | Build credibility |
| Blog post | Awareness → Consideration | Educate on problem/solution | SEO, thought leadership |
| Case study | Consideration | Prove outcomes | Support sales conversations |
| Email (nurture) | Consideration | Stay top of mind | Move toward conversion |
| Email (campaign) | Consideration → Conversion | Drive specific action | Qualify interest |
| Service deep-dive | Consideration | Explain the engagement | Self-qualification |
| Whitepaper / guide | Awareness → Consideration | Authority positioning | Lead generation |
| Sales deck / one-pager | Conversion | Support sales meeting | Leave-behind |

### Pipeline Principles

1. **Every content piece has exactly one primary job.** It's either building awareness, supporting consideration, or driving conversion. If it's trying to do all three, it's doing none well
2. **Awareness content should never sell.** The fastest way to lose a product leader's attention is to pitch them when they came for insight
3. **Proof points escalate with the funnel.** At awareness: industry observations and general claims. At consideration: engagement outcomes and service differentiation. At conversion: specific client results, pricing, and engagement details
4. **Track content → pipeline attribution.** When a prospect enters the pipeline, note which content they engaged with. This informs future calendar prioritization
5. **Sales enablement is content too.** One-pagers, talking points, and engagement proposals are content that feeds the conversion stage. Include them in the editorial calendar
