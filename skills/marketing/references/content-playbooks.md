## LinkedIn Post Playbook

### Platform Specs & Best Practices

| Spec | Guideline |
|------|-----------|
| **Target length** | 150-200 words (1,000-1,300 characters). Sweet spot for B2B thought leadership targeting senior buyers |
| **Character limit** | 3,000 characters max per post |
| **"See more" cutoff** | ~210 characters (~2 lines). Your hook MUST land before this break |
| **Paragraph length** | 1-2 sentences max. Never write a paragraph longer than 2 sentences |
| **White space** | Blank line between every paragraph. LinkedIn rewards scannability |
| **Reading level** | 5th-8th grade. Clear and direct, not dumbed down |
| **Hashtags** | 3-5 per post, placed at the end. Mix industry and topic tags |
| **Links** | Place in the first comment, not in the post body. Links in the post reduce reach |
| **Posting cadence** | 2-3 posts/week. Minimum 18-24 hours between posts |
| **Best posting times** | Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM or 12-2 PM in your audience's time zone |
| **Format mix** | 70% text posts, 20% carousels/images, 10% video or documents |

### The Hook Formula

The first 2 lines are the most valuable real estate. They appear before the "see more" cutoff and determine whether anyone reads the rest. Every hook should create a curiosity gap or make a claim worth reading.

**Stat Hook (strongest for data-driven posts):**
> 73% of product teams say they're "data-driven." Most have never talked to a user.

**Pattern Interrupt:**
> The bottleneck has shifted.

**Counterintuitive Insight:**
> The best product teams ship slower than you think.

**Direct Statement:**
> Most product teams skip the step that matters most.

**Question:**
> What if your roadmap is the problem, not your team?

**Observation:**
> I've talked to 50+ product leaders this year. They all say the same thing.

**Hook test:** Read only the first two lines in isolation. If they don't earn the click, rewrite them.

### Post Structures

Each structure is optimized for LinkedIn formatting: short paragraphs (1-2 sentences max), blank line between every paragraph, scannable on mobile. Target 150-200 words total.

---

**The Insight Post**

Best for: Industry observations, research findings, trend analysis. Awareness job.

```
[Hook: 1-2 lines. Bold stat, observation, or claim. Must land before "see more" cutoff]

[Context: 1-2 sentences. Why this matters right now]

[Insight: 1-2 sentences. The key realization or shift]

[Evidence: 1-2 sentences. One proof point or specific example]

[Takeaway: 1-2 sentences. What this means for the reader]

[CTA: 1 sentence. Question or invitation to engage]
```

Principles:
- Lead with the most surprising or specific data point
- One insight per post. If you have two, save the second for next week
- Evidence should be concrete (a number, a quote, a named outcome)
- End with a question that invites the reader to share their experience

---

**The Story Post**

Best for: Client outcome narratives, engagement lessons, real-world examples. Engagement job.

```
[Hook: 1-2 lines. Moment of tension, surprise, or a relatable situation. Must land before "see more"]

[Setup: 1-2 sentences. Who, what, where. Just enough context]

[Conflict: 2-3 sentences. What was broken, missing, or failing]

[Resolution: 2-3 sentences. What changed and what happened as a result]

[Lesson: 1-2 sentences. The broader takeaway that applies beyond this one story]

[CTA: 1 sentence. Question that invites the reader to relate]
```

Principles:
- Start in the middle of the story, not at the beginning
- Keep setup minimal. Readers don't need background, they need tension
- The resolution should feel earned, not like a sales pitch
- The lesson should be useful even if the reader never hires you

---

**The Framework Post**

Best for: Mental models, methodologies, structured thinking. Awareness job.

```
[Hook: 1-2 lines. The problem this framework solves. Must land before "see more"]

[Framework intro: 1 sentence. Name it or set it up]

[Step/Point 1: 1 sentence]
[Step/Point 2: 1 sentence]
[Step/Point 3: 1 sentence]

[Why this works: 1-2 sentences. Ground it in evidence or experience]

[CTA: 1 sentence. Invite the reader to add to the framework or share their approach]
```

Principles:
- 3 steps or points maximum. More than 3 loses the post's scannability
- Each step should be a complete thought in one sentence
- Name the framework if possible (named frameworks get saved and shared more)
- The "why this works" section is what separates a useful post from a listicle

---

**The Contrarian Post**

Best for: Challenging conventional wisdom, differentiated perspectives. Awareness job.

```
[Hook: 1-2 lines. The popular belief you're challenging. Must land before "see more"]

[Why people believe this: 1-2 sentences. Acknowledge the logic]

[What the data shows instead: 2-3 sentences. Your counter-evidence]

[The better framing: 1-2 sentences. Reframe the problem or question]

[CTA: 1 sentence. Question that invites debate or agreement]
```

Principles:
- Challenge the idea, not the people who hold it. "This approach is incomplete" not "You're doing it wrong"
- Acknowledge why the current belief makes sense before countering it
- The counter-evidence must be specific. Contrarian without data is just opinion
- These posts generate the most comments. End with a question that invites disagreement

### Post Checklist

- [ ] Hook lands before the "see more" cutoff (~210 characters)
- [ ] Total length is 150-200 words
- [ ] Every paragraph is 1-2 sentences max
- [ ] Blank line between every paragraph

- [ ] Specific, not generic (includes at least one data point or concrete detail)
- [ ] Matches brand voice (calm, credible, no hype)
- [ ] No em dashes, no exclamation points
- [ ] CTA is a soft question, not a hard sell
- [ ] Links placed in first comment, not in the post body
- [ ] Would a senior product leader stop scrolling for this?

## Blog Post Playbook

### Purpose

Long-form content that educates, builds authority, and drives organic traffic. Each blog post maps to a content pillar from `content-strategy.md` and serves a specific pipeline stage (usually awareness → consideration).

### Structure (800-1200 words)

```
[Title: Specific, benefit-oriented, includes primary keyword]

[Hook: 2-3 sentences. State the problem or tension. Make the reader feel seen]

[Context: Why this matters now. Industry data, trend, or trigger event]

[Core Argument: The insight or framework — this is the meat. Use subheadings,
 short paragraphs, and proof points from proof-points.md]

[Evidence: Case study excerpt, engagement data, or third-party stats.
 Cite sources. Respect anonymization status]

[So What: Practical takeaway the reader can use regardless of whether
 they hire you]

[CTA: Soft — related content, newsletter signup, or "book a conversation"
 depending on pipeline stage]
```

### SEO Considerations

- **Primary keyword in title, first 100 words, and one subheading**
- **Meta description:** 150-160 characters, includes primary keyword and a reason to click
- **Internal links:** Link to related blog posts, case studies, or landing pages
- **External links:** Cite third-party stats where used
- **Readability:** Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences), subheadings every 200-300 words, no walls of text

### Blog Post Checklist

- [ ] Maps to one content pillar
- [ ] 800-1200 words (not padded, not cramped)
- [ ] Hook earns the first scroll
- [ ] Proof points cited with correct status (public vs. anonymized)
- [ ] One clear takeaway the reader can use immediately
- [ ] CTA matches the pipeline stage
- [ ] Title works as a LinkedIn share headline

## Case Study Pipeline Playbook

A full pipeline from raw source material to published case study and derivative content.

### Stage 1: Source Material Intake

**Inputs:** Engagement summary, client outcomes, deliverable samples, internal notes

**Actions:**
- Identify the source type and completeness
- Check `proof-points.md` for existing evidence from this client
- Determine anonymization requirement: check the Status column in proof-points.md. If "Anonymized only," all output must use a generic descriptor, never the real name

### Stage 2: Metric Extraction

Pull 5-10 key data points from the source material:
- Quantitative metrics (timeline, delivery speed, adoption, outcomes)
- Qualitative outcomes (workflow changes, team dynamics, capability gains)
- Quotes (if available and approved)
- Timeline and engagement context

**Output:** Structured metric brief — a bulleted list of facts, each tagged with its anonymization status.

### Stage 3: Anonymization (If Required)

- Replace company name with generic industry descriptor (e.g., "Series B Fintech Startup")
- Remove identifying details: team names, product names, locations
- Keep metrics, outcomes, and methodology — these are the value
- Cross-check every derivative in Stage 6 for consistency

### Stage 4: Draft Case Study (500-800 words)

**Structure:**

**1. Client Snapshot (50 words)**
- Company type/stage (anonymized if required)
- Team size, industry, what they do

**2. The Challenge (100 words)**
- What problem they faced and why it mattered
- What they'd tried before, stakes of not solving it

**3. The Approach (150 words)**
- What Baseline provided
- Key methodologies used, how the engagement worked, timeline

**4. The Results (150 words)**
- Specific outcomes and metrics
- Qualitative changes, what's different now

**5. Key Insight (100 words)**
- What was learned, what this means for similar organizations

### Stage 5: Client Approval Gate

- **Public case study:** Requires explicit client approval before any external use
- **Anonymized case study:** Can be used externally if properly anonymized per Stage 3
- **Internal only:** Can be used for sales enablement and internal strategy without approval
- **Flag for review:** Any use of named client beyond logo permission

### Stage 6: Derivative Content

Once the case study is approved, produce derivatives using the repurposing chain from `content-strategy.md`:

| Derivative | Format | Use |
|------------|--------|-----|
| LinkedIn pull quotes | 1-2 key metrics + insight, 150-200 words | Awareness |
| Sales deck metrics | 3-5 headline stats, formatted for slides | Conversion |
| Talking points | Verbal summary for conversations | Meetings |
| Blog post | Expanded narrative, 800-1200 words | Consideration |
| Email excerpt | 1 data point + CTA | Nurture |

### Writing Principles

- **Lead with outcomes, not process.** They care about results
- **Be specific.** "+59% throughput" beats "improved efficiency"
- **Let the transformation speak.** Minimal self-congratulation
- **Show the before and after.** Make the change tangible
- **Anonymize consistently.** If the source is anonymized, every derivative is anonymized

### What to Avoid

- Vague claims ("great results")
- Process heroics ("we worked so hard")
- Unapproved client quotes
- Confidential information
- Mixing anonymization levels across derivatives from the same source
