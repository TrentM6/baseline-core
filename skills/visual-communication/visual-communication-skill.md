# Visual Communication

Visual communication makes the invisible visible. Product decisions, strategic trade-offs, data patterns, and stakeholder narratives all become clearer when you can see them. Every visual should make a complex idea easier to understand and act on.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Design serves understanding.** Presentations, diagrams, and visualizations exist to make ideas clearer. If the design obscures the message, it's failed.

2. **One idea per visual.** Each slide, diagram, or chart should communicate one thing clearly. Complexity comes from combining simple visuals, not cramming everything into one.

3. **Restraint is sophisticated.** Premium product work doesn't scream for attention. It commands it through restraint and intentionality.

4. **Templates enable speed.** Well-built templates let you move fast without sacrificing quality. Invest in systems.

5. **Know the audience and context.** A board deck has different requirements than a sprint review. Design for who will see it and what decisions it needs to support.

6. **Less, better.** Fewer elements, more impact. Remove until it breaks, then add one thing back.

### Industry Principles

7. **Visual hierarchy guides attention.** Size, color, and position direct where people look and in what order.

8. **White space is active.** Empty space isn't wasted space. It creates focus and breathing room.

9. **Consistent color builds recognition.** Use brand colors consistently. Don't introduce new colors without reason.

10. **Typography carries voice.** Font choices and treatment communicate tone. Match type to message.

11. **Accessibility matters.** Sufficient contrast, readable sizes, and colorblind-safe palettes make design inclusive.

12. **File formats serve purpose.** PNG for transparency, JPG for photos, SVG for icons, PDF for documents.

## Workflow

> Follow the [Workflow Orchestration Pattern](../../frameworks/workflow-orchestration.md) for the universal workflow approach. Below are the visual communication-specific details for each step.

### 1. Clarify Before Starting

Before any visual communication work, answer:

- **What's the deliverable?** Presentation, diagram, decision visualization, data story, infographic?
- **What decision does this support?** What should the audience understand or decide after seeing this?
- **Who's the audience?** Executives, product team, engineering, external stakeholders?
- **Where will this live?** Slide deck, Notion, FigJam, print, embedded in a doc?
- **What brand assets exist?** Logo, colors, fonts, templates
- **What are the specs?** Size, format, resolution requirements

### 2. Load Relevant Context

**Core context (always load):**
- `core/identity.md` — Brand positioning, terminology
- `core/voice.md` — Tone, language rules

**Extended context (load for visual communication):**
- `extended/visual-identity.md` — Colors, fonts, typography, components
- Brand guidelines if they exist (logo usage, additional assets)

**Load when needed:**
- [Visual Design Fundamentals](references/visual-design-fundamentals.md) — Design principles, color theory, data visualization
- Existing visual materials (for pattern consistency)
- Templates for the deliverable type

### 3. Choose the Right Approach

| Deliverable | Key Considerations |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Presentation | Story flow, one idea per slide, visual hierarchy |
| Decision Visualization | Options clearly framed, trade-offs visible, recommendation highlighted |
| Data Story | Narrative arc, key insight surfaced, context provided |
| Diagram | Clarity over decoration, logical flow, labeled elements |
| Infographic | Data accuracy, scannable, visual interest |
| Product Narrative Deck | Strategic arc, evidence-backed, stakeholder-appropriate depth |

### 4. Design Process

**For Presentations:**
1. Outline story structure first
2. One idea per slide
3. Visual hierarchy — make the point obvious
4. Speaker talks, slides support
5. Use master slides for consistency
6. Review for consistency and flow

**For Decision Visualizations:**
1. Identify the decision and options being evaluated
2. Define criteria and trade-offs
3. Choose the right format (matrix, comparison table, decision tree, trade-off map)
4. Make the recommendation visually clear
5. Include supporting evidence
6. Test: can someone understand the recommendation without explanation?

**For Data Stories:**
1. Start with the insight, not the data
2. Build a narrative arc (context → tension → insight → implication)
3. Choose chart types that serve the story
4. Annotate key moments and inflection points
5. End with what this means for decisions
6. Test: does the takeaway land in 5 seconds?

**For Diagrams:**
1. Understand what you're explaining
2. Identify elements and relationships
3. Choose the right type (flowchart, process, architecture, etc.)
4. Prioritize clarity over decoration
5. Label everything
6. Test: can someone understand this without explanation?

## Visual Types

### Presentations

**Structure:**
- Opening: Title, context, agenda
- Body: One idea per slide, logical build
- Closing: Summary, next steps, contact

**Slide Principles:**
- Title at top (consistent position)
- Headlines, not paragraphs (6 words max guideline)
- No more than 6 lines per slide
- Visual hierarchy guides the eye
- Full-bleed images when impactful

**Slide Types:**
- Title slide: Topic, context, date
- Section divider: Section name, visual break
- Content slide: Title + supporting content
- Quote slide: Quote large, attribution small
- Data slide: Chart + key takeaway headline
- Image slide: Full/large image, minimal text
- Decision slide: Options, criteria, recommendation

### Decision Visualizations

**Types:**
- Decision matrix: Options scored against weighted criteria
- Trade-off map: Two axes showing where options fall
- Decision tree: Branching paths based on conditions
- Comparison table: Side-by-side feature/option comparison
- Option spectrum: Options ranked along a single dimension
- Impact/effort matrix: Prioritization quadrants

**Principles:**
- Frame the decision clearly at the top
- Make criteria explicit and visible
- Highlight the recommended option
- Show trade-offs honestly — don't hide downsides
- Include enough context for someone to disagree intelligently

### Data Stories

**Structure:**
- Context: Why this data matters right now
- Tension: What the data reveals that's surprising or concerning
- Insight: The key finding, visualized clearly
- Implication: What this means for product decisions

**Principles:**
- Lead with the insight headline, not the chart title
- Annotate inflection points and anomalies
- Use comparison to create meaning (vs. last quarter, vs. goal, vs. competitor)
- One chart per insight — don't overload
- End with "so what" — connect data to decisions

### Diagrams

**Types:**
- Flowchart: Process flow, decision trees
- Architecture diagram: System components and relationships
- Process diagram: Steps in sequence
- Concept map: Relationships between ideas
- Timeline: Events over time
- User flow: Steps a user takes through a product

**Principles:**
- Clarity first — could someone understand without explanation?
- Labels on everything
- Consistent shapes for same types
- Color used purposefully (not decoratively)
- White space aids comprehension

### Product Narrative Decks

**Types:**
- Strategy presentation: Vision, market, roadmap, why now
- Investor/board update: Metrics, progress, asks
- Quarterly review: What shipped, what learned, what's next
- Product vision: Where we're going and why

**Structure:**
- Hook: Why should they care? (1-2 slides)
- Context: Market, users, problem (2-3 slides)
- Strategy: What we're doing and why (3-5 slides)
- Evidence: Data, traction, validation (2-3 slides)
- Ask: What you need from the audience (1 slide)

**Principles:**
- Tell a story, don't dump information
- Every slide earns its place
- Data supports narrative — don't let slides become spreadsheets
- Match depth to audience (board = strategic, team = tactical)

## Visual Elements

### Color Usage

**Primary colors:** Main elements, CTAs, emphasis
**Secondary colors:** Support, variety without clashing
**Neutral colors:** Backgrounds, text, dividers
**Accent colors:** Sparingly, for highlight

### Typography

**Hierarchy:**
- Display/Title: Largest, boldest
- Heading: Clear section markers
- Body: Readable at length
- Caption: Smallest, supporting

### File Management

**Naming:** `[project]-[type]-[description]-[version].[ext]`

Example: `client-presentation-quarterly-review-v2.pptx`

**Export Formats:**
| Format | Use For |
|--------|---------|
| PNG | Graphics with transparency |
| JPG | Photos, complex images |
| SVG | Icons, simple graphics, scalable |
| PDF | Documents, presentations for sharing |
| PPT/PPTX | Editable presentations |

**PDF from HTML/CSS:** If the deliverable was authored as styled HTML/CSS (whitepapers, branded documents, reports), use the [html-to-pdf](../../scripts/file-system/html-to-pdf.md) script to convert to PDF with full CSS fidelity.
