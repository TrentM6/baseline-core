# Sales

Sales is about finding the right clients, not convincing the wrong ones. The goal is mutual fit — qualifying hard, communicating clearly, and only working with clients who will genuinely benefit.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Qualify hard, early.** The worst outcome is winning a bad client. Better to say no fast than suffer through a misaligned engagement.

2. **Sell the outcome, not the process.** Clients don't buy research or workflows. They buy clarity, speed, and leverage. Focus on what they get.

3. **Direct communication always.** No sales tricks. No pressure tactics. Just honest conversation about fit and value.

4. **Let them sell themselves.** Good discovery surfaces their problems. If you're the right fit, they'll feel it.

5. **Warm is better than cold.** Referrals close faster and make better clients. Invest in relationships, not spray-and-pray.

6. **Price anchors confidence.** Don't apologize for pricing. Premium positioning attracts premium clients.

7. **Scarcity only if real.** If you have limited capacity, mention it honestly. Don't manufacture urgency.

### Industry Principles

8. **Research before reaching out.** Know their company, their role, their likely challenges before any outreach.

9. **Discovery is the sale.** The better the discovery, the easier the close. Understand deeply.

10. **Follow up without being annoying.** Persistent but respectful. Add value in follow-ups, don't just "check in."

11. **Proposals should feel like a formality.** If you've done discovery well, the proposal confirms what they already know.

12. **Track and learn.** Know your conversion rates. Know what works. Iterate.

## Workflow

> Follow the [Workflow Orchestration Pattern](../../_FRAMEWORKS/workflow-orchestration.md) for the universal workflow approach. Below are the sales-specific details for each step.

### 1. Clarify Before Starting

Before any sales activity, answer:

- **What stage?** Prospecting, outreach, discovery, proposal, close?
- **What do I know?** Research on company, role, likely challenges
- **What's the goal?** Get a meeting, qualify fit, close the deal?
- **What's my capacity?** Can I actually take on new work?

### 2. Load Relevant Context

**Core context (always load):**
- `core/identity.md` — Services, positioning, terminology
- `core/voice.md` — Tone, language rules

**Extended context (load for sales):**
- `extended/pricing.md` — Service tiers, scope, pricing philosophy
- `extended/icp.md` — Ideal client profile, qualification criteria

**Load when needed:**
- [Sales Fundamentals](references/sales-fundamentals.md) — Objection handling, discovery questions

### 3. Prospecting

**Identify potential fits using ICP criteria:**
- Company stage and size
- Role of buyer
- Signs of relevant challenges
- Budget indicators

**Research before outreach:**
- Company news (funding, launches, hires)
- Product/market (what they're building, who for)
- Buyer's background (LinkedIn, content they've shared)
- Potential pain points (based on stage and role)

**Red flag check:** Disqualify if ICP criteria not met.

### 4. Outreach

**Warm outreach (preferred):**
- Referral from mutual connection
- Previous interaction (event, content engagement)
- They responded to your content

**Structure:**
```
[Personal connection or context]
[Observation about their situation]
[How you might help — briefly]
[Low-friction ask]
```

**Cold outreach (when necessary):**
- Use PAS framework (Problem → Agitate → Solution)
- Keep under 100 words
- One clear ask (usually a conversation)
- No attachments or links in first message
- Follow up 2-3 times max, then move on

### 5. Discovery Call

**Purpose:** Understand their situation, qualify fit, let them experience working with you.

**Structure (30-45 min):**

1. **Opening (5 min):** Brief intro (30 seconds), set agenda
2. **Discovery (20-25 min):**
   - Situation: "What's the current state?"
   - Problem: "What's the biggest constraint?"
   - Impact: "What happens if this doesn't get solved?"
   - Previous attempts: "What have you tried?"
3. **Overview (10 min):** Tailored to what they've shared
4. **Next Steps (5 min):**
   - If fit: "I'll send over a proposal"
   - If unsure: "Let me think about whether I can help"
   - If not fit: "I don't think I'm right for this, but here's what I'd suggest..."

### 6. Proposal

**When to send:** After discovery call, only if genuine fit, within 48 hours

**Structure:**
1. Context (what you heard from them)
2. Approach (what you'll do)
3. Investment (pricing, terms)
4. About you (brief, relevant)
5. Next steps (how to proceed)

**Principles:**
- One page if possible (two max)
- Reflect their language back
- No pricing surprises (discussed on call)
- Clear, simple, confident

### 7. Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Too expensive" | Acknowledge, reframe (cost of not solving), hold price |
| "Need to think about it" | Clarify what information would help, set follow-up |
| "Can you do it faster/cheaper?" | Explain why timeline matters, offer scope alternatives |
| "Burned by consultants before" | Acknowledge, differentiate (direct, no handoffs) |
| "Need to loop in others" | Offer to join a call with stakeholders |

### 8. Close

**Signs they're ready:**
- Asking about timeline and logistics
- Discussing internal alignment
- Asking how to get started

**After they say yes:**
- Contract within 24 hours
- Invoice per payment terms
- Schedule kickoff
- Transition to delivery mode

### 9. Relationship Cultivation

Referrals are the best source of new clients. Cultivate relationships systematically.

**For referral sources (people who might send you clients):**
- Quarterly check-ins (not asking for referrals, adding value)
- Share relevant content or introductions when useful to them
- Acknowledge when referrals convert (thank them, keep them informed)

**For past clients:**
- 2-week post-engagement check-in (part of standard delivery)
- Quarterly touchpoint (share relevant insights, ask how things are going)
- Annual "how's it going" check-in (maintain relationship)

**For warm network (industry peers, former colleagues):**
- Engage with their content consistently
- Share your work and thinking publicly
- Be helpful without expectation

**What NOT to do:**
- Ask for referrals in every interaction
- Only reach out when you need something
- Let relationships go cold for years

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Instead |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Spray and pray** | Low quality, damages reputation | Research, personalize, fewer better |
| **Pitching before understanding** | Seems desperate, misses fit | Discovery first, pitch second |
| **Ignoring red flags** | Bad client, painful engagement | Qualify hard, say no early |
| **Discounting to win** | Attracts wrong clients, undervalues work | Hold price, reduce scope if needed |
| **Generic proposals** | Feels like a template | Reflect their specific situation |
| **Going dark after no response** | Leaves money on table | Follow up 2-3 times with value |

## When to Use This Skill vs. Others

| If you need to... | Use this skill | Not... |
|-------------------|----------------|--------|
| Write sales outreach | Sales | Marketing (different intent) |
| Run discovery calls | Sales | Research & Synthesis (different purpose) |
| Create proposals | Sales | Copywriting (strategic, not just words) |
| Write marketing emails | Marketing | Sales (nurturing vs. selling) |
| Research prospects | Sales | Research & Synthesis (lighter touch) |

---

## Output Expectations

**Outreach message:** Under 100 words, specific to them, one clear ask

**Discovery call:** 30-45 min, deep understanding, clear next step

**Proposal:** 1-2 pages, reflects their language, no surprises, confident pricing

**Follow-up:** Adds value, respects their time, knows when to stop

---

## When to Escalate

Flag for review when:

- Pricing negotiation beyond standard terms
- Scope changes affecting engagement model
- Prospect wants something outside standard services
- Red flags appear mid-process
- References or introductions to past clients requested
- Any commitment to deliverables or timeline
