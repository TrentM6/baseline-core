## The Baseline Sales Philosophy

### What Makes Baseline Sales Different

1. **Qualification over persuasion.** The goal isn't to close everyone — it's to find the right clients fast and let the wrong ones go.

2. **Discovery IS the sale.** A great discovery call does 90% of the work. If you understand deeply, the close is easy.

3. **Honest conversation.** No manipulation, no pressure tactics. Just direct talk about fit and value.

4. **Premium positioning.** Baseline isn't trying to be the cheapest option. Price anchors confidence.

5. **Relationship-first.** Warm intros and referrals beat cold outreach every time. Invest in relationships.

## The Buyer's Journey

### For Baseline's ICP

**Stage 1: Unaware**
They don't know they have a problem. They're "busy" and assume that's normal.

**Stage 2: Problem Aware**
They feel the pain. "We're shipping but not sure it's the right things." They don't know solutions exist.

**Stage 3: Solution Aware**
They know options exist (consultants, agencies, hiring). They're evaluating.

**Stage 4: Product Aware**
They know about Baseline specifically. They're comparing.

**Stage 5: Ready to Buy**
They've decided Baseline is right. They need to move forward.

### Implications

- **Cold outreach** works best at Stage 2-3 (problem aware, looking for solutions)
- **Content marketing** builds awareness at Stage 1-2
- **Discovery calls** move people from Stage 3 to Stage 5
- **Proposals** convert Stage 4-5

## Discovery Frameworks

### SPIN Selling (Adapted)

**Situation Questions:**
What's their current state?
- "Walk me through how your team works today."
- "What does your product development process look like?"
- "How do you currently make decisions about what to build?"

**Problem Questions:**
What's not working?
- "What's the biggest constraint your team faces?"
- "Where do things break down?"
- "What keeps you up at night about the product?"

**Implication Questions:**
What happens if this doesn't change?
- "What's the cost of continuing this way?"
- "What happens if you ship the wrong thing?"
- "How does this affect the team / the company / your goals?"

**Need-Payoff Questions:**
What would solving this mean?
- "What would change if you had clarity on what to build?"
- "How would your team operate if they were 10x faster?"
- "What would success look like in 6 months?"

### The Gap Analysis

**Current State:** Where are they now?
**Desired State:** Where do they want to be?
**Gap:** What's preventing them from getting there?
**Bridge:** How does Baseline close that gap?

The goal of discovery is to make the gap feel real and the bridge feel obvious.

## Objection Framework

### The LAER Model

**Listen:** Let them finish. Don't interrupt or get defensive.

**Acknowledge:** Show you heard them. "I understand" or "That makes sense."

**Explore:** Understand the real concern. "Can you tell me more about that?" Often the stated objection isn't the real one.

**Respond:** Address the actual concern directly.

### Common Objections Map

| Stated Objection | Real Concern | Response Approach |
|------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| "Too expensive" | Not sure of ROI | Reframe value, explore cost of inaction |
| "Need to think about it" | Unclear on something | Clarify what's missing |
| "Need stakeholder buy-in" | They can't decide alone | Offer to help, qualify decision process |
| "Bad experience with consultants" | Trust issues | Differentiate, offer proof |
| "Not the right time" | Not urgent enough | Explore timing, stay in touch |
| "Can we do less scope?" | Budget constraint | Discuss alternatives, don't over-discount |

## Pricing Psychology

### Why Premium Pricing Works for Baseline

1. **Signals quality.** Low prices signal low value. Premium prices signal premium work.

2. **Attracts right clients.** Clients who push hard on budget often push hard on everything.

3. **Creates commitment.** People value what they pay for. Higher investment = more engagement.

4. **Sustains the business.** One senior person can only do so much. Premium pricing makes solo work sustainable.

### How to Present Pricing

**Do:**
- State it confidently (no hedging, no apologizing)
- Discuss on the call before proposal (no surprises)
- Frame as investment, not cost
- Tie to outcomes they care about

**Don't:**
- Lead with price
- Offer discounts proactively
- Compare to cheaper alternatives
- Justify with hours/effort

### Handling Price Pushback

1. **Acknowledge:** "I understand it's a significant investment."
2. **Reframe:** "What's the cost of [continuing with the problem]?"
3. **Hold:** "This is the price for the work done right. If budget is a constraint, we could discuss a smaller scope, but I don't discount."
4. **Walk away if needed:** Some clients aren't a fit. That's okay.

## Follow-Up Cadence

### After Outreach (No Response)

| Touchpoint | Timing | Approach |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Initial | Day 0 | Personalized outreach |
| Follow-up 1 | Day 3-4 | Shorter, reference initial |
| Follow-up 2 | Day 7-8 | Add value (article, insight) |
| Final | Day 14 | "Last one" — give them an out |

After 4 touches with no response, move on. They're not ready.

### After Discovery (Proposal Sent)

| Touchpoint | Timing | Approach |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Proposal | Day 0 | Send proposal |
| Follow-up 1 | Day 3 | "Any questions?" |
| Follow-up 2 | Day 7 | Add value or insight |
| Check-in | Day 14 | "Where are you in your thinking?" |
| Final | Day 21 | "Still interested, or should I close this out?" |

## Referral Strategy

### Why Referrals Matter

- Close faster (trust is pre-established)
- Better fit (referrer understands both parties)
- Lower effort (no cold outreach)
- Higher lifetime value (better clients stick around)

### How to Generate Referrals

**From Past Clients:**
- Deliver exceptional work (prerequisite)
- At end of engagement: "Who else do you know who might benefit from this?"
- Stay in touch post-engagement
- Make it easy to refer (give them language to use)

**From Network:**
- Be helpful without expecting return
- Stay visible (LinkedIn, events, content)
- Ask specifically: "I'm looking to connect with [type of person] at [type of company]"
- Offer to help them in return

**From the Market:**
- Content that gets shared
- Speaking at events
- Being quotable and memorable

### Making Intro Requests

**Do:**
- Be specific about who you want to meet
- Explain why you think it's a fit
- Make it easy (offer to write the intro)
- Express gratitude

**Don't:**
- Ask for vague "anyone who might need help"
- Put the burden on them to figure out fit
- Forget to follow up and close the loop

## CRM and Pipeline Hygiene

### What to Track

**For Each Deal:**
- Company name and key contact
- How they found Baseline (source)
- Stage in pipeline
- Key dates (first contact, discovery, proposal sent)
- Notes from each interaction
- Next action and date
- Potential deal size

**Aggregate Metrics:**
- Conversion rate by stage
- Average deal cycle time
- Win rate by source (referral vs. cold vs. inbound)
- Revenue by service type

### Pipeline Review Rhythm

**Weekly:**
- Review all active deals
- Update stages and next actions
- Identify stuck deals

**Monthly:**
- Analyze conversion rates
- Assess pipeline coverage (enough leads?)
- Review lost deals (patterns?)
