## The Principles of Design

### Balance

**Symmetrical Balance:**
- Elements mirrored on both sides
- Feels formal, stable, traditional
- Use for: Corporate, traditional, serious content

**Asymmetrical Balance:**
- Different elements that still feel balanced
- Feels dynamic, interesting, modern
- Use for: Creative, contemporary content

**Radial Balance:**
- Elements radiate from a center point
- Feels focused, centered
- Use for: Diagrams, focused concepts

### Contrast

Creates visual interest and hierarchy. Achieved through:
- Size (large vs. small)
- Color (light vs. dark, bright vs. muted)
- Weight (bold vs. light)
- Shape (geometric vs. organic)
- Texture (smooth vs. rough)

**Rule:** If elements are not the same, make them very different.

### Hierarchy

Guides the viewer through content in order of importance.

**Establish through:**
- Size: Larger = more important
- Position: Top/left seen first (Western reading)
- Color: Brighter/more saturated draws attention
- Contrast: Higher contrast = more attention
- Isolation: Surrounded by space = more important

### Alignment

Creates order, organization, and connection.

**Types:**
- Left align: Natural reading flow, most common
- Center align: Formal, less text-friendly
- Right align: Uncommon, specific uses
- Justify: Even edges, can create awkward gaps

**Rule:** Every element should align with something else. No random placement.

### Repetition

Creates cohesion and recognition.

**Repeat:**
- Colors
- Fonts
- Shapes
- Spacing
- Visual treatments

**Rule:** Establish patterns and follow them consistently.

### Proximity

Related things should be closer together. Unrelated things farther apart.

**Creates:**
- Logical groupings
- Visual organization
- Implied relationships

**Rule:** Group by relationship, not by convenience.

### White Space

Empty space is not wasted space. It:
- Creates focus
- Provides breathing room
- Signals sophistication
- Improves readability

**Rule:** When in doubt, add more space.

## Color Theory

### Color Relationships

**Complementary:**
- Colors opposite on the wheel
- High contrast, vibrant
- Use one as dominant, other as accent

**Analogous:**
- Colors adjacent on the wheel
- Harmonious, unified
- Low contrast, serene feel

**Triadic:**
- Three colors equally spaced on wheel
- Balanced, vibrant
- One dominant, two accent

**Split Complementary:**
- One color plus two adjacent to its complement
- Balanced contrast
- More nuance than direct complementary

### Color Properties

**Hue:** The color itself (red, blue, green)
**Saturation:** Intensity (vivid to muted)
**Value:** Lightness/darkness (light to dark)

### Color Psychology

| Color | Associations | Use For |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Blue | Trust, calm, professional | Finance, tech, corporate |
| Red | Energy, urgency, passion | Sales, alerts, bold brands |
| Green | Growth, nature, success | Health, eco, finance |
| Yellow | Optimism, warmth, attention | Caution, highlight, happy |
| Purple | Luxury, creativity, wisdom | Premium, creative brands |
| Orange | Friendly, energetic, affordable | Youth, value brands |
| Black | Sophisticated, powerful | Luxury, minimal |
| White | Clean, simple, space | Modern, clean brands |

### Color in Practice

**Brand colors:**
- Use primary brand color consistently
- Reserve accent colors for emphasis
- Don't introduce new colors without reason

**Functional colors:**
- Error: Red
- Success: Green
- Warning: Yellow/Orange
- Info: Blue

**Accessibility:**
- Test contrast ratios
- Don't rely on color alone
- Consider colorblind users

## Typography Fundamentals

### Type Classification

**Serif:**
- Has small lines at ends of strokes
- Traditional, trustworthy, readable
- Use for: Body text, formal content

**Sans-serif:**
- No serifs, clean lines
- Modern, clean, digital-friendly
- Use for: Headlines, UI, modern brands

**Display:**
- Decorative, distinctive
- Low readability at small sizes
- Use for: Headlines only, sparingly

**Monospace:**
- Equal width characters
- Technical, code-like
- Use for: Code, data, specific styles

### Typography Hierarchy

**Display/Title:** 32-72pt
- Largest, most prominent
- Used for main headlines
- Can be more decorative

**Heading:** 20-32pt
- Section markers
- Clear, readable
- Consistent treatment

**Body:** 14-18pt
- Main content
- Maximum readability
- Comfortable line length

**Caption/Small:** 10-14pt
- Supporting info
- Labels, footnotes
- Still readable

### Typography Best Practices

**Line Length:**
- 50-75 characters ideal for body
- Too wide = hard to track
- Too narrow = choppy reading

**Line Height:**
- 1.4-1.6x font size for body
- Tighter for headlines
- Looser for small text

**Letter Spacing:**
- Tighter for large headlines
- Default for body text
- Looser for all caps

**Avoid:**
- More than 2-3 fonts per design
- Too many weights/styles
- Centered text for long passages
- Full justification (creates rivers)

## Layout Principles

### Grid Systems

**Why use grids:**
- Create order and consistency
- Make decisions faster
- Align elements purposefully

**Common grids:**
- 12-column: Flexible, web standard
- 4-column: Simple, mobile-friendly
- Modular: For complex layouts

### The Rule of Thirds

Divide space into thirds (vertical and horizontal). Place key elements at intersections or along lines.

### F-Pattern and Z-Pattern

**F-Pattern:**
- Users scan horizontally across top
- Then down left side
- Horizontal scans decrease
- Best for: Text-heavy content

**Z-Pattern:**
- Eye travels top-left → top-right → bottom-left → bottom-right
- Best for: Minimal content, CTAs

### Golden Ratio

Approximately 1:1.618 proportion. Creates naturally pleasing proportions.

Use for:
- Sizing relationships
- Spacing
- Layout divisions

### Responsive Considerations

**Mobile first:**
- Design for smallest screen first
- Add complexity for larger screens

**Breakpoints:**
- Content determines breakpoints
- Don't rely only on device sizes

**Flexibility:**
- Elements should adapt, not just shrink
- Consider different reading patterns

## Image Guidelines

### Image Quality

**Resolution:**
- Web: 72-96 PPI
- Print: 300 PPI minimum
- Retina: 2x standard resolution

**File size:**
- Optimize for web
- Balance quality and load time
- Consider lazy loading for web

### Image Composition

**Rule of Thirds:**
- Place subjects at intersection points
- Creates dynamic, balanced images

**Leading Lines:**
- Guide eye through image
- Create depth and interest

**Negative Space:**
- Space around subject
- Creates focus, room for text

### Image Treatment

**Consistency:**
- Same style across a project
- Color treatment, filters, cropping
- Creates cohesive visual language

**Overlays:**
- Darken images for text overlay
- Brand color overlays for consistency
- Don't obscure important details

### Stock Photography

**Avoid:**
- Obviously posed
- Generic business clichés
- Watermarked images
- Low quality or resolution

**Look for:**
- Natural, authentic moments
- Relevant to your content
- Good technical quality
- Proper licensing

## Data Visualization

### Chart Types

**Bar Chart:**
- Comparing quantities
- Categories vs. values
- Horizontal or vertical

**Line Chart:**
- Trends over time
- Continuous data
- Multiple series comparison

**Pie Chart:**
- Parts of a whole
- Use sparingly (max 5-6 segments)
- Start at 12 o'clock, largest first

**Scatter Plot:**
- Correlation between variables
- Distribution patterns
- Outlier identification

**Area Chart:**
- Cumulative trends
- Part-to-whole over time
- Stacked or overlapping

### Data Visualization Principles

**Clarity:**
- Label clearly
- Remove chartjunk
- Make the data the focus

**Accuracy:**
- Start Y-axis at zero (usually)
- Don't distort proportions
- Cite sources

**Accessibility:**
- Don't rely on color alone
- Sufficient contrast
- Alternative text for key insights

**Simplicity:**
- One message per chart
- Remove unnecessary elements
- Let data speak

### Common Mistakes

- 3D charts (distorts data)
- Truncated axes (misleading)
- Too many colors/categories
- Missing labels/context
- Decorative elements that obscure data

## File Formats

### Raster vs. Vector

**Raster (Bitmap):**
- Made of pixels
- Loses quality when scaled up
- Formats: PNG, JPG, GIF
- Use for: Photos, complex images

**Vector:**
- Made of mathematical paths
- Scales infinitely without quality loss
- Formats: SVG, AI, EPS
- Use for: Logos, icons, illustrations

### Format Guide

| Format | Best For | Transparency | Notes |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------|
| PNG | Graphics, screenshots | Yes | Larger files |
| JPG | Photos | No | Lossy compression |
| GIF | Simple animations | Yes | Limited colors |
| SVG | Icons, logos, web | Yes | Scalable, small |
| PDF | Documents, print | Depends | Versatile |
| EPS | Print, logos | Depends | Print standard |

### Optimization

**For web:**
- Compress without visible quality loss
- Use appropriate format
- Consider lazy loading
- Provide multiple sizes

**For print:**
- High resolution (300 PPI+)
- CMYK color mode
- Proper bleed/margins
- Vector when possible
